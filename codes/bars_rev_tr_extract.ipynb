       "  'text': \"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. \\n\\nI actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\\n\\nOk onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.\\n\\nThe portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) \\n\\nI bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. \\n\\nThe specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. \\n\\nAll in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor.\",\n",

The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn\\'t make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn\\'t because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be \"picky\" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.',\n",

We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.\\n\\nFirst, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\\n\\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. \\n\\nTo top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.\",\n",

It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return.

They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'OVERALL: The food isn\\'t good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals\\' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...\\n\\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don\\'t seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn\\'t show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There\\'s an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor\\'s. Established in 1955, it\\'s the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor\\'s offers. \\n\\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I\\'d be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \\n\\nI\\'ll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn\\'t even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \\n\\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it\\'s because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \\n\\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \\n\\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \\n\\nI won\\'t be back, but I\\'m glad to have visited this historic spot.\\n\\nService: 4 stars\\n\\nKitch: 4 stars\\n\\nFood: 1 star',\n",

       "  'text': \"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. \\n\\nMoving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area.\",\n",

This place rocks!!!\\n\\nOut of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  \\n\\nWe arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  \\n\\nWe met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!\\n\\nThe Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  \\n\\nThis is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!\",\n",

We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.\\n\\nI ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn\\'t even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.\\n\\nI also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. \\n\\nThey brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.\\n\\nYes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant.',\n",

It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I\\'m telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\\n\\nThere was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don\\'t allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It\\'s insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I\\'m sure there\\'s some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn\\'t tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn\\'t around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn\\'t let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\\n\\nOK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone\\'s there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn\\'t pay for that space though.

The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good.\\nThe flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.\\nOverall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back.\",\n",

I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far? \\n\\nWe both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. \\n\\nThey were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!\\n\\nNew Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. \\n\\nThe Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.\\n\\nMy other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. \\n\\nAlso we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. \\n\\nThe desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. \\n\\nThe oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! \\n\\nSo there you have it. \\n\\nThe service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. \\n\\nThe location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness.\",\n",

We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday. \\n\\nWe returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.  \\n\\nOverall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal.\",\n",

We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again, we will definitely be back for the ambience, the drinks, the other yummy food, but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.

I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. \\n\\nWe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \\n- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \\n- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\\n- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \\n- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \\n- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \\n- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \\n- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \\n- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \\n\\n***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol \\n\\nOVERALL RATINGS:\\nFood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\\nFood (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! \\nDrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio\\nPresentation - 4 stars\\nService & Ambiance - 4 stars\\n\\nI gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!\",\n",

The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?\\n\\nThere are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue\\'s but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \\n\\nThe second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  \\n\\nBoth of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  \\n\\nAfter all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  \\n\\nThen, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  \\n\\nWe head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  \\n\\nWe start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn\\'t know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\\n\\nWhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this \\'oh yeah\\' moment - he was oblivious at times.\\n\\nSo, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\\n\\nThe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn\\'t mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \\n\\nOK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   \\n\\nAgain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.',\n",

We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .  \\nWe were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.  \\nWe were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). \\nI was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.  \\nOn the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good! \\n Our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal.  The lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks.  As we were leaving, we see our server  sitting behind the bar, playing on his phone and chatting with other guests....\\nWe probably will not be returning to Toast for dinner. It just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93.5 sanitation grade.\",\n",

       "  'text': '7/15/17. Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. \\n\\nAs more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn\\'t seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we\\'d want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. \\n\\nWe got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said \"this happens all the time.\" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). \\n\\nAlexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it\\'s 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. \\n\\nThank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don\\'t expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best. \\n\\nThanks again! :-)',\n",

Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the \"artisan board\" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons!

Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn\\'t suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn\\'t even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying. \\n Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1. She then explained that all of their staff quit @ the same time & all the new hires are \"green\". This is still unacceptable & I don\\'t feel that anyone there is competent. Longhitano\\'s is hands down the second worst meal I\\'ve had this year!',\n",

Food was great, on time and delicious, even though when I walked in, there was a UFC fight going on and the place was packed.

       "  'text': 'I want this place to do well, because it would be great to have a fancy Mexican option in town. I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems.\\nThe drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails.\\nOne of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I\\'m pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn\\'t double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles. \\nI am somewhat annoyed that they don\\'t provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn\\'t that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry.\\nAnother rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn\\'t very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.\\n\\nI think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.\\n\\nAnother weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can\\'t help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren\\'t \"classy\" enough to wait tables.',\n",

They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.\\n\\nI get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)\\n\\nSo here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:\\n\\nThere is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???\\n\\nThe lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.\\n\\nIf you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.\\n\\nLock box is available for $20 by the entrance.\\n\\nNot going back.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.\\n\\nThis NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.\\n\\nI love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.\\n\\nSonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.\\n\\nWe started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.\\n\\nFor the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.\\n\\nMy husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.\\n\\nThere were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.\\n\\nWe were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.\\n\\nAll in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!\",\n",

One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.\\nAlso, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone.

The only food I've tried was the mac and cheese, which was ok given how much it cost.\\n\\nKelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.\\n\\nThe service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I have to give a 2 star rating - there are better bars around.\",\n",

They couldn't guarantee I'd get a table, but lo and behold everything worked out. I love that they text you to let you know your table is ready - I really hate getting phone calls.\\n\\nFood prices are expensive, but with a $5 cover and no time limit I'd be happy to pay their prices.

My friend and I came 1/1/17 at 2:15pm (they opened at 2pm) when we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait for food because they were busy. We decided that we would stay bc the restaurant was small & the crowd wasn't very large; big mistake. After we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to the table for our drink orders. Then another 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks & take our order. After over an hour my friend was brought her meal; whiting & super cold grits. The waitress said they were putting my wings in now for my chicken & waffles; after over an hour. My friend asked for new grits and after ten minutes she still hadn't received new grits and my food had not come. It was now 4pm & I was over it. We had the waitress cancel our orders. During this extremely long wait for food (of which mine never came) our waitress not once checked on our table. The person next to us canceled his check after waiting so long for food. After paying for my mimosa (given to me in a red wine glass) the waitress did offer my friend and I an expired coupon for 10% off our next visit. I'll pass.\",\n",

But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.\\n\\nThe happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.\\n\\nThe cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.\\n\\nSo I guess what I'm really saying here is, go to Kelly's for a fun atmosphere and grab a couple crazy drinks on the patio with some mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and you won't be broke or disappointed.\",\n",

It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I'm not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu. Will be going to corporate asap...never going to hooters again.\",\n",

As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.  \\n\\nAs I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.\\n\\nWhen ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!\\n\\nHow could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!  \\n\\nI would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts.\",\n",

We sat down and waited a while for our server \"Eric\" to arrive.  When he did he looked alike he had just gotten out of bed, and acted like we were wasting his time.  We ordered three things.  \\n\\n1.  Steak and Eggs which definitely missed their stop on Flavor Town, Extremely Bland!  Cooked well but again very bland.  \\n\\n2.  Chilaquiles.  Looked like it sat under a heat lamp too long and again other that the carne Asada which did taste ok we were not a fan.\\n\\n3.  Chicken fried Bacon biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy was obviously prepared by someone different the the cook that prepared the Bacon which was just above Raw.  Remember the Gravy?  Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!  \\n\\nLet me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.  \\n\\nAlso if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.\\n\\nExperience #2. 2 Stars.\\n\\nOver all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars. \\n\\nLastly the Hash House must be where Guy eats when he is in town.  They waiter stated that he had been there for a while and that Guy doesn\\'t even stop buy when he is in town.  \\n\\nWe did try the Hash House A GO Go and it was great.

She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated \"No, I don\\'t want it now\".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my \"perception\" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won\\'t be back.',\n",

It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.\\n\\nThe bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.\\n\\nThe washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well.

And the service is par excellence!\\n\\nWe wholeheartedly recommend this place for special occasions, or a date with that special someone. \\n\\nOf course, to this day, I've had the pleasure of enjoying those special evenings here with my wife, my pal, my best friend!\",\n",

We were greeted by a nice gentleman that walked us to our area and he was very friendly and gave us information on how to use the golf screen. Then a few minutes later we were greeted by Lauren to ask us what kind of drinks or any food we would like to order. She continued to check on us frequently and made the experience that much better. We ordered a pizza flatbread, chips with salsa and guacamole, and French fries with ranch. We all also ordered drinks that were brought out to us very quickly and we never had to look for anyone to order the next. All the appetizers we ordered were delicious and came out quickly as well. \\n\\nWe did one hour of golf and it was a fun experience with some great views. Also living in Arizona it can get very hot, but they do everything they can do to make you forget how hot it actually is by keeping us cool with misters and fans.

Main dishes I can recommend:  pork chops, porterhouse steak, chicken critters, sirloin steak, pulled pork dinner.  The green beans are the best in town.  Also love the loaded sweet potato. The homemade yeast rolls are something you will crave.  The chili and macaroni and cheese are subpar and I would not recommend either of these items.   If you order a margarita make sure you add a \"kicker.\"  The 1800 is the best.  It can be loud at times especially when they turn up their music and do their western dance routine.  Very reasonably priced for high quality food.',\n",

I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty! \\n\\nWell first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me. \\n\\nSecondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible. \\n\\nThe waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse. \\n\\nThe mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should've just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it. But I was so pissed off and in complete disbelief at the service and experience I couldn't think logically. This place has got to get it together.\",\n",

Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.\\n\\nFor \"shareable\",  respectable \"sashimi won-taco\" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The \"fondue dippers\" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.\\n\\nOn to the sandwiches and burgers:\\n\\n\"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that\\'s a good boy.  Now shake hands.

Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The \"off-da-hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the \"mac-n-cheese bacon burger\"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.\\n\\nProps for service.

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and seemed to be having a blast working here.\\n\\nThe food highlight was the pierogi platter ($11). It was very great to try different varieties and flavors on one plate. The kanapki ($6) were great and are also offered on a rotating basis of delicious flavors. The carrot puree was my favorite. After eating delicious comfort food, don't forget to save room for dessert as they offer some great options. The apple tart ($5) was sweet and sour and savory all in one and I would definitely recommend it.\\n\\nOverall, I really appreciated how this meatless restaurant was able to flaunt that fact with interesting flavor combinations. I don't want to eat meat at a restaurant like this and I'm glad they don't fill their menu with meat substitutes. Embrace the veggies and grains. I would highly recommend this restaurant to veg eaters or meat eaters alike in Pittsburgh.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'So about a week and a half after having some of the best BBQ St. Louis has to offer (Pappy\\'s for those in the know, check my prior reviews) I was back in AZ and ready for some. Having a week off and several friends who were fellow fans of BBQ I decided it was time to make the trip over to Little Miss while I was able to get there early and not have to wait long. Got there about 10:30 and by 11:10 I had a nice plate of juicy meat in front of me ready to go.\\n\\nLucky enough for me I came on a thursday which meant it was Pastrami day and a platter full of that, fatty brisket, beans, potato salad and an extra housemade sausage for good measure I was ready to indulge in all the essentials for BBQ.\\n\\nI have to say I was blown away by the flavors and the tenderness of the meat hear. The pastrami was incredible with a blend of spices that was out of this world there was a distinct subtle sweetness that I couldn\\'t put my finger but it was a hit probably the best I have ever had. The fatty brisket was just killer as well with a great tenderness and ton of great smoked flavor. The biggest compliment I can give these two meats is that while I tried them with the various sauces I preferred them without and I am usually the type to slather my BBQ in some sauce.\\n\\nThe homemade sausage was really good as well and work getting with some great flavor but was overshadowed by the others. The beans are more liked pulled pork with some beans added, in other words outstanding. The potato also didn\\'t disappoint.\\n\\nOne of the staff also noticed my buddies 2 young children weren\\'t eating anything when told they were picky eaters he said \"let me get the a rib to try kids tend to love them\" and he was nice enough to bring a rib for each youngster. While the kids still didn\\'t go for it after a little test bite the rest of us decided to try and they were very good and fall apart tender as well. In the absence of the Pastrami I would pair the ribs and brisket in a heartbeat for a great meal.\\n\\nThe finishing touch was the pecan pie which while small is rich enough it should be shared but it will go quick as the smokey sweetness and flaky crust is perfect capper to a great meal.\\n\\nCompared to Pappy\\'s I may actually give the edge to Little Miss because of the Pastrami but it\\'s neck and neck on ribs and brisket so the end result is that AZ has a BBQ spot that can go toe to toe with some of the best in the midwest.\\n\\nDon\\'t miss out and make the time to come here. It\\'s worth the wait.',\n",

They were basically giant rice crispy cereal pieces - not exactly amazing. \\n\\nThings went downhill fast when my mother ordered the carne asada tacos. She ate most of the taco, which, by the way, tasted average. She happened to cut a piece of the beef in half. The beef was thoroughly raw and the fat wasn't even melted.

The refried beans were dry and stale, but the fried corn was pretty good. \\n\\nWhen I complained to the staff, we got most of our meal for free and we also got a free dessert. My mom had lost her appetite, but I settled on the churros. The dainty churros were tossed into a paper bag (I've seen better presentation at the state fair).

Fin and Fino, what does that mean?\\n\\nFor lunch I selected 4 things\\n1. grilled Bahn Mi shrimp app, which was flat out spectacular. Served six perfectly grilled, decent sized shrimps. Cut these in half and had 12 ideally sized bites. Whatever it is they grill these things over, it gives the shrimp succulent, smoky char-grilled flavor. When you combine the pickled daikon/carrots, sriracha aioli, and popped sorghum onto your fork with a shrimp bite you'll have a nice sized, delicious bite. From start to finish, each bite was a wonderful taste treat!\\n2. soup of the day was shrimp gumbo. You could tell that this was a long, slow savory journey from cutting board till ending up in my bowl. Marvelous flavor, marvelous kinda-spicy seasoning, marvy aftertaste!\\n3. unsweet ice tea is something I'm particular about. Boom! Nailed it. brewed just right ... not sitting in a pitcher of melting ice for a long time before I ordered it ... refills were timely and delivered in a fresh glass ... Delicious Southern tea, just normal tasting, made like it's supposed to be, delicious tea!\\n4. half dozen raw oysters. The oyster menu is hidden in a separate menu that is really the drink menu. I never would have found them if I hadn't asked. The dinner menu is chock full of oysters. The St. Simon ones I had were elegant, sweet, wonderful looking (but undersized) oysters.

Being a student I frequent coffee shops to not only indulge in my coffee obsession but to be able to peruse the World Wide Web so I may conduct research while I study, and after I placed my order and took my seat to get down to business, much to my dismay, the wifi was not connecting, so I asked the barista who then told me sorry but the wifi was out of service and didn't know when it would be up and running again. BAD customer service!

We first received our waters and my glass had black particles in water so I got a replacement. She was not giving us much attention. The experience that she was providing to us was not very engaging. As much as I pushed to initiate conversation she was not very interested in making small talk. When we received our food and started eating she did not once ask how our food was or if there was anything else we needed. Being a server in the past, I know that's the basics of what u should be asking. \\n\\nAs for the food that we ordered it was pretty good. The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries. Only issue I had was the portion of fries that I received, it looked like someone in the kitchen ate half my fries before serving it. Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate. There were no complaints about the Pesto Chicken Penne Asiago. It was a good pasta dish. Overall with a little better customer service this place could have great potential. Jimstar Out!!\",\n",

Superb service for a burger joint.

Most of the other Korean places are a bit too expensive ~ Suri is $27 (more variety) and the Mother Korean is $25.  My wife loves Korean so we try to do it once a month.  If we went more often (esp to a buffet), I probably ballon into the Michelin man.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant, outside, it doesn't look too appealing.  In fact, it looks like a run down shack.  The inside is like a diner setup.  Kinda long and curves around the end.  However, it was kinda cozy.\\n\\nAs for the service, the 4x's that we have been there, we thought the service was pretty good (granted, all 4x's, we were with a large party).  They filled your drinks and got you a scissor, forks, and napkins pretty often.  Only issue that I had was that they only allow you one scissor per table.  Kinda sucks when you have to cut alot of Gabbi and Korean Ribs.  Otherwise, service was good.  By the way, one of the things that I do like is that they regularly change your grille when it needs changing.  \\n\\nAs for the food, dessert looks awful.  Don't go there.  There non-meat dishes are nothing to talk about.  However, you are at a Korean buffet; so, eating meat and seafood is the key.  Their meat selection and seafood are pretty good.  Actually, I think it is comparable to other Korean restaurants in town.  Each time, I usually focus on eating the shrimp and Korean BBQ ribs.  Oooh la la.  Granted, you don't get the selection of the other restaurants, but you do get your money's worth.  Also, by the time that you are done eating, you do feel like a stuff pig.  Oink!

       "  'text': \"Absolutely FANTASTIC experience here!\\n\\nAfter wanting to try River Cafe for ages, I finally had the opportunity last weekend to celebrate my sister in law's birthday. Little did I know, it was actually a food & wine pairing, which I had never done before. Needless to say I was excited, considering how much I love both of those things!\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous, but that goes without saying. Situated in the middle of Prince's Island Park, you can either park near the Eau Claire shopping centre, or across Memorial in the lot. Our reservation was for 5pm, so the sun was still shining through the big, open windows and the breeze flowed through beautifully. The decor is simple, yet classy and feels upscale but not pretentious. The overall feeling is warm & cozy, as evidenced by the beautiful throw blankets set aside for guests who get chilly. Love it already!\\n\\nOnce we arrived we were tended to by a wonderful server. I missed his name but he was fabulous - and 10 steps ahead of all of us. When someone dropped a napkin, he was there to pick it up before you even realized it fell. When you ran out of water, he was topping it up before you had the chance to ask. He was extremely polite, friendly, and knowledgeable about everything we were being served. He informed us that we would be going through 9 courses, so thank goodness I was starving! We ordered cocktails to start, I had the River Ice and it was fabulous! Light & refreshing and exactly what I was looking for.\\n\\nI know I won't remember any of the wines we were paired, all I know is that I had never given it much thought until this meal. The way the wine complimented every flavor in each dish was exquisite! We started with a soup - pureed vegetables with fresh cream and a piece of prosciutto on top. It was very tasty, albeit not as hot as I would prefer. Our next course was a lovely crab salad with asparagus & yellow and red tomatoes.  Ahhh perfection. Next we had eggplant with vine ripened tomatoes and cheese (the kind escapes me, it WAS a wine pairing after all). Once that was finished we had squid with a side of greens & toasted chickpeas. It was so delicious! When the lamb came out I was thrilled (ohgodsodamngood) it was paired with a small onion, asparagus, and crusted pork belly - mmmmm. Next was a bison tenderloin which was easily my favourite. At this point I was getting full and drunk! The desserts started coming, the first of which was a delicious ice cream sandwich with cookies, vanilla ice cream, and a delicious raspberry jam/drizzle! We finished that off with a small cheese board and finally, chocolate truffles. The presentation of each dish was well thought out and beautiful, and the wine pairings were truly beautiful and complimentary.\\n\\nI won't lie I loved every single thing we had and I ate everything off each plate. It was decadent and everyone in the group really loved it - not just the food, but the entire experience. It was such a special evening and one I wont soon forget. The food along with the amazing service ensured I will DEFINITELY be back, and I can't wait - that beautiful patio is a must!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Just had such a ridiculously terrible experience here. Our waitress, Penny, extremely neglectful until the end of the meal when she paced back and forth in front of our table a record number of times compared to how scarcely we saw her while eating. \\n\\nFirst off, she took 2 other orders before ours even though we were sat before both those tables and were ready to order. Menus closed and everything. Next while taking our order she didn\\'t write it down (which isn\\'t a smart move in a restaurant with such a large menu) and got BOTH of our orders wrong. My friend asked for fruit, and was given hash browns. And I was not only missing avocado, but even though I emphasized to have my caramelized onions well down they came out almost raw.\\n\\nShe kept doing this extremely irritating thing where she would drop items and run away and not even give her paying customers an extra .3 seconds to ask her for something. When our wrong food arrived, once again, dropped and ran away. Waited almost 5 min for her to come back. She told my friend to just keep the hash browns while she just grabbed her fruit, and went to go have my omelet remade. I left my barely touched, incorrect omelet on the table edge with untouched potatoes (theres a difference between potatoes and hash browns here. They\\'re two different sides) so finally my new omelet arrives, with no potatoes on the plate, yet she takes my incorrect plate, which had my potatoes, and doesn\\'t come back with another side of potatoes for me.... potatoes that I paid for. So basically, I was served an omelet with no side and was forced to eat the cold, soggy hash browns that she didn\\'t bother removing from the table when they came incorrectly with my friends meal. Nice.\\n\\nDon\\'t see her, doesn\\'t check in till almost another 10 minutes even though I see her wandering around the restaurant. \\nWhich was crappy because my second omelet was gross. Yes, the onions were finally cooked, but the whole omelet was burnt and dark brown, plus THE ENTIRE THING WAS CHEESE AND TOPPINGS. I picked around it and basically left an uneaten, picked at scramble mess on my plate in front of me, obviously it was clear I didn\\'t like it, and not a single inquiry from her as to why I barely touched my food. Every single thing about my friend and I was screaming that we were dissatisfied. From body language, to how our interactions with her changed throughout the meal, to the most obvious red flag which was that I barely ate anything. Then she leaves that mess in front of me till after she drops the check which took her 15 more minutes  (she did the classic run and drop without a word so we didn\\'t even have the chance to complain). Aka I had these dirty plates in front of me till after we even payed. Which was when she was pacing back and forth in front of us straight up staring at us as we placed our money down. When she finally collected the plates she goes \"you done?\" Then grabs the dirty plates AND my drink that I payed $6 for that had almost half left in it, and runs away. Yes penny, I\\'ve been done with this terrible omelet for almost a half an hour, but no, I was NOT done with my barista beverage. At the end of the meal we purposefully sat, and I counted 7 times that she paced back and forth in front of our table staring at the checkbook which was in a place where she couldn\\'t grab it. It\\'s crazy how her presence improved once the money was involved. \\n\\nTo top it off, there was a man sitting at the high top on a laptop, who I assume to be a manager or someone of authority because employees were discussing business with him. He was faced directly at our table, less than 10 feet away, and didn\\'t once notice our dissatisfaction. Terrible. \\n\\nI paid $30 to sip half of a drink, eat 3 bites of cold, soggy hashbrowns, and to pick through a mountain of swish cheese and burnt, scarce egg.\\n\\nMy friend and I have both been in the restaurant industry for almost 7 years. This was by far the most expensive and dissatisfactory meal we\\'ve ever had the burden of paying for. Penny had so many opportunities too, that is the worst part of this situation. She could have taken it upon herself to read our body language, acknowledge that fact that I didn\\'t touch my food, taken 2 extra seconds to actually SPEAK to her guests and we would have been back and tipped her well for her efforts.\\n\\nAnother ironic part of the situation is that this was my friends first time here, and we were scouting for a nice, slightly upscale restaurant to host/cater a baby shower brunch for about 30 people.\\nFor 2 of us our bill was $50, imagine having a party of 30. You do the math. That\\'s a lot of business you just lost.\\n\\nBut sorry BLD, there\\'s no chance we\\'re coming back here.',\n",

This was the first time I decided to take my clubs to TopGolf and not use their Callaway clubs at each bay. Well, be prepared to have your golf bag inspected by a staff member. You cannot take your driver, fairway woods, or hybrid irons into their facility. Only irons & wedges. I was shocked to find a 30-45 minute wait on a Thursday around 1pm! After all, it was Christmas/Winter break for all the kiddos. The backdrop isn't as pretty as the TopGolf Vegas with the Linq Ferris Wheel in and the Vegas Casino buildings on the strip in the background, or the swimming pools like Vegas but remember, you're in Arizona!!! Other than that, the same quality, service, food, and style can be appreciated here. From what we were told, Gilbert's TopGolf location is a little less crowded and busy than their sister facility in Scottsdale. I guess if you're going during their busy times, Gilbert would be preferred. Other than that, not much to dislike. The kids, novice players, moms, high schoolers, first timers, etc. should all like TopGolf! My 14-yr old son tried it for the 1st time and absolutely LOVED it! I think he's now hooked on golf, and I only took him here to try it out. Now if they could just open one up in San Diego, that would be great!\",\n",

In addition, this bar does not give free water. My friend who was driving us home and was not drinking alcohol asked for water and they would only offer bottled water for a dollar.

Everyone enjoyed their food.\\nHowever, we went on a nice night and decided to sit out on the porch. Apparently, Everly allows their patrons to bring dogs on the porch. A couple with a giant and poorly behaved dog sat down at the table next to us near the end of our meal and we spent the rest of our time with the dog sniffing around our plates and our laps. Not exactly pleasant. Another Patron with a dog sat at the outdoor bar which meant that servers and customers alike had to step over her dog and leash the entire time. It's an extremely confusing business model to have dogs run off the rest of your customers, and I would only go back there in the winter when the porch is closed. Maybe some restaurants do a good job of allowing dogs, but as Everly's porch is enclosed, there is no way to do it well.\",\n",

I imagine a cup of hot black coffee and juicy bacon strips. I imagine a massive serving of smoked salmon draped over a poached egg like an elegant table cloth. I imagine the colourful fruit, the hungover faces and the bright glasses of orange juice. I love it all!\\n\\nOn my boyfriend's final morning in Canada, we decided that  a Last Breakfast was essential. It was a Wednesday and since Dr. G's is a 5 minute walk from my apartment, we decided to walk over. It was closed. To our unpleasant surprise, on weekdays they open at half past eleven. He recommended Tim Hortons but I distracted him at Chapters until the clock struck 11:30. Best decision of my life.\\n\\nThe server was friendly and took our order right away. While we waited for our food we drew each other with crayons on the paper table cloth. Some of my finest artistic work has been executed on restaurant napkins and pub coasters. Dr. G's tablecloths provide space for extra large portraits. Mine resembled a cross between a fat blob and a furry yellow animal with blue saucers for eyes. \\n\\nWhen the food came, I forgot about my masterpiece. I ordered the Egg Dostoyevsky with mushroom cheddar chowder. It was perfect -- the egg was perfect, the sauce, the toasted bagel. They served my meal with two slices of pineapple. I wish they threw in a couple strawberries or orange slices. A breakfast isn't complete without a serving of fruit! The chowder was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the tuna melt. He evidently loved it because it was devoured within seconds. It came with the soup of the day, which he also liked. I also recommend ordering the fresh and pulpy orange juice, especially when attempting to cure a hangover.\\n\\nI regret not coming here more often. I've given many paycheques to the Firkin, which is right next door, completely forgetting that Dr. G's serves better food and bigger portions. Come here for food and go next door for beer.\",\n",

I ordered shredded pork, potato salad, and baked beans. There is plenty of food so we decided to take home  a peach cobbler. We were very impressed and have now been there another 3-4 times. I personally like a variety of flavors in my meals so this place is excellent. You get a variety of BBQ sauces from which to choose for your meat. The potato salad is creamy and not mustardy but if you want some, you can get a packet at the condiments corner.  The baked beans are sweet and just perfect in my opinion. We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge. I actually prefer it cold better than warm.  The corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion. There is a small loaf of cornbread that is good and honey is found in packets at their condiments corner. Every time we go there, nice young men circulate the room to be sure your food satisfies you. My hubby and I have settled on this as our favorite place to eat BBQ. They cater and we will surely be using them for that. The prices seem very reasonable for catering. You can leave your dirty dishes on the table to be bussed but I usually bus my own to leave more room for the next customers.

My boyfriend ordered their steak and fries and found everything too salty. Their fries had kosher salt crystals on top. Our friend on the other side found the same experience with the fries but his burger was under seasoned.

The layout is well done - so if you wanna mix into the crowd, there is a huge huge dance floor downstairs, and the music really rocks with lots of 80's (yeah I'm an 80's kid.) and less of R&B which gets sickening after you hear at any club you go.

And domestics at 3.25 are overpriced too, the same domestics at BWW during happy hour are only $3 for a 22oz tall one! I have no clue what regular prices are, but for happy hour, I'm not all that happy. Great for food, not so great if you plan to have a few beers. Dinner for two, with two beers was $47. That's a bit steep for a sports bar.\",\n",

I\\'d never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  Sad to say I\\'ll probably never eat at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant again.  We all enjoyed our food, but the service was HORRIBLE. \\n\\nIt started with our waiter basically throwing the drink menu on the table. When he came back, the first thing he said was \"do you have any questions?\"  How about your name?  Luckily we were ready to order so he took it and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It took almost an hour from when we sat down till we received our food.  The tables around us all got their food before us, even tables that sat down after us.  One table sat down after us, ordered, ate AND paid before we got our food.  At one point the waiter came by and my friend asked him where our food was and he said it would be right out.  I was getting ready to go find the manager to ask about our food when the manager came to us.  He said our food was being plated as he spoke, but it still took another 5 minutes for it to arrive.  \\n\\nAfter the manager talked to us, our waiter barely came by our table; he wouldn\\'t even make eye contact when he walked by.  He did manage to clear my drink glass, but didn\\'t bother to ask me if I wanted another one.  After the wait we\\'d had, I would have taken a second drink, but I guess he didn\\'t want us to linger.  \\n\\nIt was also disappointing that the manager didn\\'t bother to compensate us for the long wait and crappy service.  We\\'re not sure why the manager came to us, but clearly he knew something was wrong. How about trying to make it right?  If he had, I probably wouldn\\'t be writing this review.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Paid a visit here after the JT concert on Friday night - best decision all weekend. Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.\\n\\nThe ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.\\n\\nOur waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.',\n",

It was the driest pizza I have ever had.  There was virtually no sauce and what sauce there was, was completely bland.  The hand pulled mozzarella was dried to a crisp and the sausage that was finely dusted on  1/2 of the pizza - maybe around 3 Tbsp. total, resembled fine ground bacon bits.  The girls\\' meatballs had some kind of spice that does not belong in meatballs.  I am Italian and have had my share of meatballs.  Maybe they put nutmeg in it?  It was something off.  I didn\\'t say anything, but my son announced that he had eaten frozen pizzas better than this.  We were so hungry and I was just too tired to complain.  When my check came, it seemed high.

I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were.

In all honesty, Little Caesars $5.00 pizza would have been SOOOO much better! \\nWe sat at the bar, and the place was pretty packed after a recent concert and it was happy hour as well. Service was actually really quick. All staff was friendly.  \\n\\nWe went with a margarita pie because it was 50% off...and now I know why.  I am not a fan of thin crust. I don't like picking up what seems like a tortilla and having all the toppings fold over. Being a margarita pizza, obviously there are not many toppings on it.  The sauce was rancid. It was like they took a can of tomato paste and slathered it all over the tortilla like crust.  Cheese was good, as was the fresh chopped basil, but what a waste of good toppings on a crappy crust and sauce.  I never liked the thin crust/tortilla like crusts that PT's group has. Especially if you're not there for happy hour when they're 50% off, you're paying full price for something that should cost $5-$8 given the size and thickness of the pizza. \\n\\nLackluster.  \\n\\nSorry....\",\n",

Both inside the restaurant and the outdoor seating looked very nice, but since it was a nice day we sat outside. I loved sitting on the couch area with lots of pillows. Our waiter was very nice and patient with us (we were very indecisive with our food!) and gave us good recommendations when we asked. \\n\\nI tried the chicken dish and it was probably the best chicken ever! It was so tasty and fell apart so easily so it was easy to pickup. There was also some sort of macaroni and cheese sorta dish, which was okay. I wasn't too crazy about the macaroni and cheese though the chicken changed my life! After our lunch, we had three cheeses which were extremely yummy as well.\\n\\nOverall, the service was great (I never had an empty glass), the food was amazing (everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and had leftovers to bring home), and ambiance was relaxing.

       "  'text': 'I had a few hours to spare before my flight so I went on Yelp and searched for best lunch in Phoenix. Little Miss BBQ was near the top of the list with 5 stars and over 600 reviews. I pulled into the parking lot at 10:45 AM and saw there were at least 30 people on line and the parking lot was full. I had a feeling I stumbled into something magical. I was the first in line to wait for a spot. Little did I know that this special place in line would allow me to talk for about half an hour with Denny and hear the entire story behind Little Miss BBQ. I also learned that since it was Thursday, I was in for a treat because there was pastrami! After sampling the brisket and sausage, I truly felt that divine intervention led me here. Scott\\'s enthusiasm and passion for his food is instantly contagious! I knew I needed to share this experience with my husband, but didn\\'t know if I could get the food through airport security and back home to FL. Scott offered to vacuum seal my order so I could pack it in my suitcase. I was looking around to see if there were any video cameras and everyone was on their best behavior because they were being recorded. Nope, just a regular Thursday at Little Miss BBQ. I must have sat at my table for over an hour savoring every magical bite of \"fatty\" brisket, \"fatty\" pastrami and jalapeño cheddar grits. I couldn\\'t tell you how their sauces taste because I didn\\'t dare interfere with the flavor party already going on in my mouth. Scott and Denny both checked on me while I was sitting there to make sure I was enjoying my experience. I didn\\'t ever want to leave. I felt like a VIP even though I was just a regular customer. Scott helped me pack up my leftovers. I took my leftovers along with my vacuum sealed to-go order And headed to the airport with grease on my chin and a huge smile on my face. When I returned the rental car, the attendant asked how my day was and I gushed about my lunch experience. He jokingly asked me if I brought him any and I handed him my leftovers. Felt blessed and grateful that I was able to pay it forward. So the short story is that I went somewhere for lunch and ended up with an unexpected life changing culinary experience. Not bad for a Thursday!',\n",

I was drawing a serious blank when the sis shouted, \"ORIGIONAL HAMBURGER WORKS!\" ARR?? *lil puppy ears raise up in a questioning manner*\\n\\nShe quickly drove us there and it was adjacent to Phoenix College and had a cool Encanto vibe... I dug it. It\\'s right next to this paint ur own ceramic pottery place that seemed so cool! When we entered the works...\\n\\nIt is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it\\'s cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!\\n\\nWe had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there! \\n\\nTheir burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there\\'s no crazy toppings that don\\'t make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?! WTF?? it comes with a boat and a car! sweet!! the perfect sides!! I bet burgers totally taste better on a boat!! Now if only I could get a $1,000,000 to find out if it\\'s true!! But since I couldn\\'t afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese. The sis chose a side order of half zucchini & onion rings and the cuz threw it DOWN that night yo!! TWO half pound patties with cheese! I\\'m not cool enough to hang with that! :(\\n\\nWe went around the corner, through the labrynth and paid we told the chick our name and got our cups, the soda fountain area is so cool! I love the Iced Tea section, there were many options to choose from! Sweetened black tea and green tea, raspberry and unsweetened tea... lovesit! and my sister\\'s happy to see Red Creme soda can be found there too! \\n\\nWhen the food was ready I walked up to the wagon \\'o toppings and had FUN! I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth! But somehow i managed and it was soo yummy!! Freshy cooked over a fire, it was so great! I haven\\'t had such a good burger in a long time!\\n\\nmy ONLY complaint is that I wasn\\'t sure about the daily meal deals... I didn\\'t see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?! NOT COOL!!\\n\\nBut seriously, the people are cool and so are the other diners, there were tons of yummy firemen when I we went! Also, the attached bar looks like an awesome place to get drunk in!! It\\'s totally on the list of places to try out! I really enjoyed myself here and got crazy full off of my huge burger and baby side! I still can\\'t believe the cuz could handle a large double burger!! Craziness!! I\\'ll definately be back with more in tow!\\n\\nTo my yelpers: i say go!! and try the burgers and marvel at the round lil circles of bacon atop of a perfectly charred burger! Load up on the toppings (like I did) and try not to bitch about the small sides (like I did) and try each of different types of tea (like I did) and maybe even a beer or two and don\\'t ask a fireman if you can see their hose... (like I did) cuz they just MIGHT! but BOOO!!! They took me out to their truck instead of getting out of their trunks!!',\n",

The bread was nice and chewy, steak was overlooked and under seasoned, and the aoli was flavorless.  The charcuterie salad was ok, I think the Dijon dressing competed a little too much with the other flavored. A balsamic vinaigrette would've probably been better.

I couldn't tell you what it was but it was not very pleasant.  So, the fish was actually decent on its own, but they put some very old and hard to chew meat under it that was absolutely nasty.  Chunks of stuff they really should have thrown away but they put it under the fish. There must have been a single stalk of asparagus under there also.  That was the meal.

The last two times I've been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.    \\n\\n\\nNow the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.    What they've managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu, drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices.\\n\\nNow you're stuck with overpriced, dry and unappetizing sliders, food that tastes of dirty oil and more.       Their pizzas in the past were fantastic, the crap they're serving up nowadays reminds me more of generic frozen-food aisle grocery store pizza(not even Digiorno).     So the food tastes awful, but they've had the audacity to raises the prices.\\n\\nNow you're sitting there, paying way above-par prices for sub-par food.   WTF man?

Conversion to Sunday brunch would require you to accept the fact that you don't need to wake up early on Sunday, and therefore you can allow yourself to eat something that is heavier than just breakfast.

I love the concept as we usually have brunch with our friends, family, or loved ones; hence, brunch builds a sense of community.

Polished cement floors, old looking light fixtures, all black, white, and gray with a very-large-bar.\\n\\nWe started with the deviled eggs with chives, radish salad, and bacon. It was delicious and we were all fighting to get the last piece. I opted for having their grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomatoes and salad. It was simple but perfect. The strong cheese was balanced by the tomatoes- so yummy! My friends loved their choices and we were all pleased with our waitress. I recall drinking copious amounts of coffee on that day and not eating ANYTHING ELSE after having that meal. \\n\\nWe spent a few hours at the restaurant and we had a great time! I would love to come back there for another brunch or maybe dinner one day. It feels good to be able to write a review like this one!\",\n",

We went here for brunch after church and were promptly ushered to a comfortable, covered outdoor patio. What first struck me was the dog-friendly section was packed while the indoor tables were sparely populated. This place is a magnet for dog owners. Everybody seemed to get along. The owners wisely figured out that packing dogs too closely together could lead to territorial disputes.\\n\\nWe ordered a delicious hummus appetizer and the sunny side up pizza. Our dog slept through the hummus plate but woke up when the pizza arrived sprinkled with bits of bacon. I got through two slices before she wormed out of the shoulder bag carrier and had her paws on the table. I gave her a dish with some egg yolk, bacon sprinkles, and a bit of pizza crust. She was happy, I was happy and relaxed.

Ugh.  We were waiting for a party so we decided to just order drinks to start.  We sat there for a good while not being checked up on, with no sauces on our table, or even asked if we wanted appetizers while we waited.  I was livid.  When the waiter finally did come back, we decided to just order before he disappeared again.  Also while we were sitting there were at least 6 staff members (the hostess included) just standing around chit-chatting in the empty area.  I noticed that the hostess was annoyed to be called to the front when patrons arrived.\\n\\nWhen we did get our food, it was tasty as usual.

Although we are in our mid 30\\'s and live a half a mile down the road, we look a lot younger and the owner/manager never gave us a second look even though they talked with everybody around us that were clearly over 30.  We ordered only tapas, so we could taste a variety.  The prices are above normal tapas food, but if the food was amazing we wouldn\\'t mind.  The mussels were just okay, market street cafe way better.  The beef tenderloin was so salty we couldn\\'t finish it. (We usually everything).

I love the décor when we walked in..  rustic and typical bbq joint - but cool at the same time.  Spacious - and nice lighting.  We were seated promptly at a booth in the front of the restaurant.  It was fun to people watch - the comings and goings on Carson.  The menu was short and simple..  2 sides if you were to get Ribs or Pulled Pork. ..nice.  My nephew ordered the half rack of ribs and mac and cheese and waffle fries.    I had to taste the ribs.. they were good but more fat than meat for sure.   That\\'s the chance you take with ordering ribs.  Some have more meat than others.  There was bbq sauce on the table -which was nice but not several different flavors like some bbq establishments.  \\n\\nI ordered the buffalo blue burger.. think it was called that.  It was probably one of the best burgers I have ever had.   Bursting with flavor.. my taste buds were singing and no doubt that burger was a \\'life changer\" (my reference to anything that blows my mind).  We ordered the Cajun - wet style wings for an appetizer and they were dam good - super flavorful.  The service was great.  I checked out the ladies room (but of course) and the décor is so cute..  and was clean.  Prices not bad - typical.   Our meal came to about $40.00 which was standard.   I noticed there was a dj stand too..  cant wait to go back for that some evening!   \\n\\nPuzzling I went to the website twelvepgh.com to share some menu items with some friends- as I was raving about the restaurant and to see if events are posted etc.  The website is under construction? I thought this establishment was open for a while - having a current update to date website is pretty important I would think.  That was a little disappointing. Well at least the website list the hours. Thank goodness for the beloved YELP providing information to the community and the best way possible! \\n\\nThank you ...I will no doubt be back.',\n",

Go figure.\\n\\nI'm a bit of a millionaire (actual percentage varies but it has been known to exceed the single digits) so I decided that I was going to pick up the check on dinner for the three nights we were in town. I made all the reservations and I made sure we were all on time. I am that kind of guy. This is how I have amassed my aforementioned fortune. Details. The deets.\\n\\nWe got to Palazzo a few minutes late, actually, so disregard anything I said about our timeliness. Anyway, they seated us right away. We had a nice round table with a view of a support column. It was one hell of a sexy support column, mind you. All white and supporty-looking. Damn. I bet it works nights on the other side of town if you know what I mean right right right?\\n\\nOK this review is getting carried away with itself, I'm sorry about that. Realizing that most of my family were classless heathens from New Hampshire I decided to let the waitress know our food allergies and from there, order anything she thought we might like. This might be the time to let you know that if you do this, they do a very good job of selecting tasty, pain-free food, but it may result in somewhat of a shock to your wallet. Just an FYI, really. Five people, with limited alcohol being served, and the bill came to about $450 after tip.\\n\\nA dent in my bank account, you see, as I am ballin' out of control. I want to say something about making it precipitate that hasn't already been said but I can't think of something witty enough to include here. Please imagine dollar bills falling from cumulus clouds at a rapid pace.\\n\\nEveryone was happy with the meal, though on the way in one of our group suggested that we go to Senor Frogs instead, and I almost did a 180 and walked back to my white Audi A5 2.0T with tan leather trim and drove all the way back to LA that instant, leaving my brother behind, even though he wasn't the one who made the comment. Almost. But I didn't, because it was mom's 60th birthday weekend and I wasn't going to let them bring me down, bro.\\n\\nPS we ended up going to Senor Frogs for drinks after and it was fun, too. My brother ordered a drink that almost came out in a glass shaped like male genitalia. These are the moments that Instagram was invented for, brother.\\n\\nIf I were you, I would listen to the following advice from me: go to SUSHISAMBA and remember that money is temporary but food is forever. And then order like a man on the electric chair. YOLO for sure.\",\n",

I knew I wouldn\\'t enjoy it as general admission (I don\\'t know if I would have enjoyed it when I was 21 either) so my party opted to make reservations several weeks in advance for a cabana.  We got a \"deal\" through a VIP host but were still shelling out a hefty sum to have a bit of shade and respite from the crowds.  The contract said to arrive by 11:30am to honor our reservation and also stated that if we didn\\'t show, we would be charged $1500 for a missed reservation.  The majority of my group showed up at 11am (when they opened) and proceeded to wait in line for almost an hour.  The line wasn\\'t that long but the promoters outright ignored us and attended to people around us.  When someone finally acknowledged us, our reservation was completely messed up and in order for us to get something similar to our original reservation (but still a downgrade), we had to pay an extra $1000 over our original price.\\n\\nI nearly lost it when they continued to make us wait...I vocalized my frustration and we were finally escorted to our cabana.  What a disappointment!!!  The cabanas range from $3000 to $10,000 and it\\'s basically just a room and an adjacent day bed overlooking the beach club.  I was grateful to have a cool place to rest when I couldn\\'t handle the heat any longer and didn\\'t want to risk catching an STD in the pool that my friend deemed \"people soup.\"  We ordered copious amounts of food, drinks, bottles of water, ice cream, magnums of champagne...everything we could to meet the minimum and cover our cabana fee.  It was the definition of opulence and wastefulness.  I felt a little bit like Marie Antoinette.\\n\\nOur VIP host found me after we were settled in our cabana and apologized for the confusion but could do nothing about the extra $1000 or the down-graded cabana.  It was an empty apology.  She was contrite with me but gave my husband attitude, saying that she was embarrassed because we ruined her relationship with the people at the club.  I found this to be completely unprofessional and if she had just shown up on time, she could have saved her own relationships.\\n\\nI really expected better service from a hotel like Encore.  This experience really left a sour taste in my mouth and I would check out the beach club at Marquee over Encore in a heartbeat.',\n",

The man that works to the right side of the bar was flirting with me the whole time, I just thought that he was being nice trying to make his tips and stuff until I ended up throwing up. I was under the impression I was ordering 9$ patron shots I ended up spending 60$ on them...Next day my brother and I were talking and he told me the reason I threw up was because I was drinking nothing but \"well\" drinks which are only supposed to be 3 bucks or something..So the bartender ripped me off and got me sick :(( I came 2 days later on NYE and confronted him and he just laughed at me! I tipped him good too like 10 bucks uggh such a ghetto feeling I had..Anyways 2 hours into the night right after 12 pm my bf wanted to go smoke a cig outside in the patio and accidentally brought it in cause he was a bit faded and this african american security guard put my bf in a head lock and was dragging him outside..My bf was not resisting or anything of the sort. I mean couldnt you have just said hey man you cant smoke it here you gotta leave or hey just dont smoke..Its not like he was being violent or anything! Anyways, once I saw the bouncer choking my bf, I ran after to tell him to stop hurting him and he kicked me out and called me fat. I left my purse inside and I asked if I could get it and he said no fat girl, just kept saying that. After about 10 mins or so of yelling and stuff I finally gave up and went to the front to have my brother look for it and it was missing. Stolen! My night ended there and I took a cab home. \\n\\nSo in conclusion, if you are coming out to AZ I would deff not recommend this bar to anyone. My brother was talking to a man who said he was going to be a manager there in a couple months and he was super nice buying him drinks and stuff and he was telling my brother about how much work needed be done to clean this place up. I really hope he makes a change cause this place has potential! I love to dance and this aspect is what initially attracted me to come here. If you come within the next 2 months expect the same or worse to happen to you..getting ripped off, chocked out for no reason, kicked out for no reason, called bad names, and having your belongings held hostage. Im still traumatized by this place, hopefully Ill get over it soon and hopefully the new owner steps in and makes this place shine like it should! :)',\n",

I have fond memories of fish and chips in the UK and this wasn't quite the same. The steak in my friend's steak pie was so flavourful and tender. A lot of the time I've had dry and not tasty meat in pies such as this. \\n\\nWhen it came time to pay I reached inside my backpack for my wallet and found that the lid on my container of cherries had popped off. There were mushed cherries at the bottom of my backpack, it was quite gross. The waitress saw the displeasure on my face and when I asked for a couple of napkins she offered to wet a couple for me. What service! She even got me a ziplock bag so that my cherries would not create more of a mess for me. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable and sitting at the back enjoying the atmosphere was lovely.

       "  'text': \"I was in Madison for a quick business meeting and love trying new BBQ joints. I visited Smoky Jon's last Thursday for some Q before returning to the airport. I received a warm welcome from the nice lady behind the counter. She asked where I was from when she heard my Southern accent and I gave her one of the BBQ Judge business cards.\\n\\nI pondered the extensive menu and chose a sampler plate to try both ribs and brisket. I was disappointed to learn that they were out of sliced brisket, but they had chopped brisket. I ordered, sat down, and the food arrived very fast.\\n\\nThe 4 bone ribs were covered in a chunky heavy BBQ sauce. I normally like my ribs dry, and don't care for chunky sauces, but this sauce was surprisingly good. The ribs had a beautiful smoke ring and smokey taste. The only complaint about the ribs is they don't remove the membrane from the back of the ribs. The membrane leaves a thin plastic like skin that must be removed before eating.  \\n\\nOn a few occasions I have had chopped brisket, usually when a cook messes up the brisket and it is too tough to serve sliced. However, I don't think that was the situation at Smoky Jon's.  A large helping of chopped brisket was placed on a large bun without sauce. The surprise to me was how finely chopped the brisket was; my experience with chopped brisket is  it is chopped into chunks, not finely shredded like at Smoky Jon's. Regardless, the taste was good and it was a large portion.\\n\\nThe baked beans were good, but I didn't care for the mac & cheese side dish. The mac & cheese was too cheesy for my taste, but I recognize I was in Cheese Land so I am not surprised that they used extra cheese.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is lined with log cabin style wood and a huge trophy case displays there numerous BBQ contest trophies. Additionally, some of the walls have magazine covers showing their selection as BBQ restaurant of the year for many years in a row.\\n\\nOverall, Smoky Jon's has good BBQ, especially for being north of the Mason-Dixon Line. I would have given 5 stars if the rib membrane had been removed and the mac & cheese wasn't so cheesy. Good Q and good people at Smoky Jon's!!!!\",\n",

Take your well earned dollars and put 'em to use elsewhere (1)\\n\\nThe only thing that made Firkin at least bearable was the knowledge that we paid for our meal mostly with a Groupon deal. Other than that, our experience here was poor.\\n\\nWe came here Monday night during a football game and they had jacked up the volume to ear drum splitting levels. The hubs and I were literally texting across the table because we couldn't hear each other even though we were shouting at the top of our lungs. \\n\\nWe'd come primarily to taste their English pub food and not to imbibe. However I'm thinking the food probably would have tasted better if you were f&*king trashed to hell.\\n\\nWe ordered the Apple Cobbler, Chicken Pot Pie, Tomato Soup, and the Baby Spinach salad. Of the four dishes, the only ones which was vaguely edible was the salad and the soup. \\n\\nI ordered the baby spinach salad with bacon, tomato, pine nuts and dried cranberries with balsamic dressing ($8.95). The pine nuts were raw. The tomato was mealy. The bacon was served in ungainly large chunks while the dressing was completely generic. But at least this was the most edible thing we ordered.\\n\\nThe tomato soup ($4.95) paled in comparison to good ol' Campbell's soup. It tasted like warmed over ketchup with very little complexity and no basil flavouring to speak of. But again - at least edible.\\n\\nWhat wasn't edible was the two items that required pie crust. Undercooked, it was doughy and completely unappetizing in both the chicken pot pie and the apple cobbler. The chicken pot pie's crust was simply not cooked and soggy. Add the gloppy pie filling consisting of macerated chicken pieces, carrots and celery, it made for an unappealing dish.\\n\\nIn the apple cobbler, where the pie crust served as a base, the chef had obviously neglected to pre-bake the crust underneath the pie to actual cook the pastry. Throw in the fact that the crumble topping was not even browned, it was an all around fail.\\n\\nPerhaps  the only redeeming quality of the place was that the servers were pleasant and they tried to do their best despite the loud noise and the obvious kitchen issues.\\n\\nThankfully, we had a Groupon to use at this culinary wasteland and therefore did not pay full price for the items we were served. I pity others who have. For the slow kitchen and poor quality food, this place rates a 2-star and only because our service was okay. Would not recommend.\",\n",

Luckily while we were waiting, we were under an awning so the wait wasn't too dreadful in the Arizona heat. They opened up on the dot at 11 am and we were in. We ordered the fatty brisket(highly recommended), beef ribs, pulled pork, pork spare ribs, and sausage. Everything was pretty darn good, but the fatty brisket was theeee best. I think next time we go, we're definitely getting a LOT more of the fatty brisket. The sides were decent, and I actually enjoyed their grits. It tasted a lot like mashed potatoes.  \\n\\nI also highly recommend the smoked pecan pie for dessert. It was superb. You won't regret it. The staff is family owned and run so they're super friendly and will come and talk to you at your table while you eat to ask how everything is or if you need anything. You almost feel like you're at a family gathering. \\n\\nThe seating is limited inside, but this is one of those order, eat, and leave kind of spots, so by the time you are up to the counter and order your food, there is a chance for an open table. So if you go, don't sit around after eating and have a long deep conversation with friends. There are people outside waiting in 100 degree weather wanting to eat in a nice air conditioned room, sit, and enjoy their food too. Don't be that group.\\n\\nOverall, this place has great customer service, the staff is friendly and warm, and the food is amazing. Give this establishment a try, you won't regret it. Just get there early.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've eaten at Emporio Meatball Joint, the first floor restaurant of Sienna Mercato, several times before writing this review and the consistency of the high quality food and outstanding service is beyond impressive. After many meals with lots of different people in groups ranging between four and 14, the food always rocks and the service is always flawless.\\n\\nThe menu is has some great starters. My favorites include the crab balls, Buffalo chicken balls and the rocket salad. The entrees are all meatballs, which seems improbable, but with the three step fun process  -- pick your ball, pick your sauce and pick your preparation (and perhaps a side), the possibilities are endless and it never gets old. I'm a fan of keeping it simple with the saucy balls. Servers can often suggest some winning combinations with particular sauces and sides. There's an extensive craft beer selection that's heavy on local brews, some good cocktails and an adequate selection of wines.\\n\\nService is always on-point. I have to give the restaurant props for the ease with which they handle large tables. On at least two occasions I've had over a dozen people at a single table. Not only does the staff nail it by getting orders correct and having courses arrive at once, but upon request they cheerfully provide separate checks (yes, even for 12 persons!) and they make it look easy. I can think of a lot of restaurants that could learn a thing or two from the customer service that Emporio provides.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is fun and lively with a good soundtrack. Big windows at the front open to the sidewalk when the weather is nice. There are high-top tables in the bar available too.\\n\\nThere's no reservations,but it's a sizeable place and tables are always turning over. Plus, they use the No Wait smartphone app very effectively and the bar area is an inviting place to wait, as is Il Tetto, the third floor rooftop bar worthy of its own praise (as is Mezzo, the second floor restaurant).\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with downtown Pittsburgh, it's worth nothing that the restaurant is very close to the convention center, Westin Hotel and Courtyard by Marriott and is only a few blocks from the theaters of the cultural district and the bridges that lead to PNC Park and the Warhol Museum.\",\n",

The \"fatty\" was the crisped, rendered & seasoned \"edges\"..omgoodness yum! You have a choice of meats by the pound or 1-2 meat & sides. After hearing many ppl in line we skipped the sides and went all meat. and I\\'ll tell you what.... the wait was WORTH EVERY MINUTE!! Absolutely the best BBQ EVER!\\n\\nOn top of succulent & juicy meat with incredible bark..they had their sauces (spicy, house and a spicy mustard) all very good but the meat didn\\'t even need it.  You\\'re asked if you\\'d like bread, side of sweet pickles, jalepeno and sliced white onions. We don\\'t usually eat lots of bread but took a few sliced of the simple, plain white bread with the smoked, juicy turkey...along with the pickles & mustard..YUM!\\n\\nOk..so today they had lamb neck & beef short ribs (the beef short rib was about a pound each!)

We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal, a request he gladly obliged, and we were welcomed warmly in various ways: 1) A lovely greeting from Chris, excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared, 2) prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started, 3) a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers.\\n\\nThe food was fresh and delicious, though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese. After an hour long post-dinner chat about vegan cooking secrets, he was (dare I say) excited about the idea of trying something completely new in the kitchen.

It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.\\n  \\nCafé Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.  \\n\\nYou will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.  \\n\\nThe lofty recommendation to visit Café Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Super disappointing. Two of my girlfriends and I went here recently for dinner. The decor is amazing. Impeccable. We sat on the patio with the large door open. The entire vibe is perfect. The chairs weren\\'t comfortable but the look was amazing. But that\\'s about where it ends. We all ordered drinks - I didn\\'t love mine at first and our server offered to swap it out. I got a blackberry mixed drink instead. Don\\'t remember the name but it was pretty good. My friend asked about the bread - our server said he\\'d bring them out. So we waited. We ordered. \\n\\nMy friends ordered burgers and mac and cheese. I ordered the meat special - crab cake with the two sides the server recommended, squash casserole and mac and cheese. Our food came out (we had to ask about the bread again and it was brought out with our meal) and it was a major disappointment. Both of my friends ordered their burgers a certain temp (neither of which was well done) and both were served well done. My one friend ordered her burger with no tomato jam but there was tomato jam on it. She bit into it and within minutes had an allergic reaction. They apologized, redid the burgers and comped their meal, so the customer service was good. The second round of burgers had the right ingredients but were still well done. As for my crab cake? Meh. It was kinda wet and soggy inside. I ended up mainly eating the outside of it and leaving the soggy part on the plate. The sides weren\\'t great to me. I only ate a few bites of the mac because I limit dairy. I brought the remainder home to fiance to eat and he described them as \"just okay\". \\n\\nFor the inconvenience of having to redo the meals, they offered us dessert. We shared the oatmeal cookie and hummingbird cake. They were the best part of the meal. \\n\\nOverall - it was a major disappointment. I won\\'t be back.\\n\\nUpdate: a few hours after eating here, I had the worst stomach ache and got sick twice throughout the night. The next morning I see a text from one of my girlfriends who ate with me the night before at Packhouse and she reports the same!',\n",

Can\\'t wait to go to that one and see if it\\'s the same thing as this scottsdale location. \\n\\nThey have two bars, one large bar downstairs and one smaller bar upstairs where the booth/range things are! The downstairs bar is pretty cool to chill with friends while waiting for your table! The bar upstairs is not really needed once you actually get your booth cause the waiter/waitress can take care of your drinks from there!\\n\\nThe food is actually not bad here too! There are a lot of snacks and foods that are easily shareable with more than 6 people! It\\'s gets kinda pricey though so be careful not to over-order at first! \\n\\nOverall I LOVE Topgolf, and I\\'ll always end up here every so often!\\n\\nTips:\\n1) Go at night! It\\'s wayyyy cooler, and you get to see the neon lights and stuff!\\n2) If you\\'re going on Friday or Saturday at night, MAKE A RESERVATION ONLINE! It\\'s so easy! Or else you\\'ll have to wait for at least an hour\\n3) Get the cheese fries, it\\'s probably the best snack food to get there\\n4) If you\\'re celebrating a birthday or something, call in advance! They can help you set up your booth and stuff if you have balloons, cake, etc \\n5) The bathrooms are clean here, go ahead and go poop!

Indeed, this is the only good Mexican restaurant I can find in the Charlotte area that can be anything close to authentic.  Although, the style is much more Tex-Mex and not what I am use to from living on the West Coast most of my life.\\n\\nI am giving the service, however, one star!   \\n\\nThe place is very crowded and obviously, understaffed.  I\\'ve had a few problems coming to this restaurant.  The first time I came it took them over 45 minutes to get me my meal and I almost had to walk out, but the meal finally came and I was just visiting Charlotte and starving that night, so I waited.\\n\\nHowever, my third time coming I ordered a beef chimichanga.   Well, when I received the order I started eating it and finally noticed they did not give me beef, but chicken.  I mentioned it to them and they were not sorry at all and did not offer to reimburse me.  Instead, they said, \"OH YEAH, THAT HAPPENS A LOT HERE\".  I am like WTH???  They made me pay for the full price of the meal and did not offer any compensation or any apologies at all..   I guess TOUGH LUCK if they screw up your order, right?   They could have marked a little off my bill, since I did not ask them to bring it back and re-cook it.\\n\\nAs well, the servers are always unfriendly and act like you are bothering them. I always go to the bar because the place is so packed and really does not have enough space for the amount of people who go there.  I don\\'t even bother coming to this place on the weekend.  The owners need to find a larger building or hire more staff.   \\n\\nSeriously, this place has horrible service and even makes me question if I want to come back.  Charlotte is hurting for good, authentic Mexican and that is why this place is so popular, because it is quite good.  However, expect to be treated like you are a burden. Basically, the only thing they want is your money.. They want to seat you, slap food on the table, take your money and get rid of you as quick as possible.  It is not a very uplifting experience to eat here, even though the food is good.',\n",

We were unable to get in on our first attempt due to dress code requirements. We went home and changed our sandals to meet the requirements and when we came back we were told we could not enter due to not having passports. Craig, the manager asked us to \"convince him\" which I assume meant to give him more money to enter. At that point I told him that the people who work for him are dumbasses for not checking ID and asking for more valid ID. He was asking for two forms of ID from people from the Czech Republic. A passport is valid anywhere in the world which is what was presented at the time and all valid. Craig decided he didn\\'t like me calling his employees dumbasses and pushed me into another lady patron, knocking us both to the floor. Then, my wife decided to stand up for me and tell Craig that he could not push her husband down (embarrassing) and punched her in the face. Not professional or legal I\\'m pretty sure. When I asked him for his name, he would not give his last name as I\\'m sure he did not want to be recognized for what he had done. My wife, who I am so incredibly grateful for, kept me from going back to call the police and/or doing harm to Craig.

They only marked up the pricing less than half on our bottle and many places usually mark up the prices much more than that. The menu changes every other week so it's unlikely you will be able to try what I tried.\\n\\nTo cut a long story short.........\\n\\nAtmosphere is amazing.....if weather is nice you might want to request patio dining in your reservation.\\n\\nService was very professional and servers are trained in sommelier training.\\n\\nThe food is mostly very detailed and high quality. \\n\\nIf they offer the Squash Blossom Relleno - GET IT......It was one of the very best things I tried anywhere. Very Complex and full of textures...so flavorful....wish I could eat a plate of them.\\n\\nAnother favorite of the evening was the Yellow Fin Tuna Crudo.......Really Great......full of flavors.\\n\\nThe dirt......Chairs inside are not so comfortable. Springs are broken and chairs are in need of repair or replacement.\\n\\nMore DIRT.....Not a fan of the Bananas Foster bread pudding....so much so I might never order dessert here again...Very dense, not sweet, unripe bananas.....\\n\\nA most lovely dinner....not perfect....but for the most part if I ignore the dessert ...then very good -  to -  exceptional.\\n\\n4.5 stars\",\n",

It has a smallish inside with free wireless, a coffee bar, and a small but well-appointed menu that is just full of delicious stuff.  There's a huge outside patio which has some good tree-shade so that it's palatable even when it's a bit too hot to sit outside under other circumstances.\\n\\nWe had some of everything when we went.  The panini are served with this thick (in size--it wasn't very dense at all) bread that is buttery and flaky and golden all at once, and really good ingredients.  My mom got the melon and prosciutto panini.  I got the veggie panini (tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes, etc) which was really great--my personal preference would be fewer red peppers but I just plucked them off.  There's a chimichurri panini.  All really good.  There's a panini (I'm guessing the singular of panini is panino but how pretentious should I get in this forum?) with mozzarella and tomato and basil.  Yesterday was vegetarian day, and there were plenty of options for that.\\n\\nThey also offer bruschetta, where you choose from a bunch of different options--mostly the same as would be available on the panini, so a lot of the above possibilities--and that received rave reviews as well.\\n\\nThe wine was half off.  The cappuccinos were tasty (I hear).  Sam was charming.  What more can I say?\\n\\nAh--one more thing.  They had a flourless chocolate dessert from Tammie Coe, which was my first experience with a Tammie Coe item, and it was reeeeeally good.  It was called the Chocolate Sensational and it had a few berries around the rich chocolate thing.  I would add more berries if I were god.  But I'm not, I keep getting told.\\n\\nOne final note.  There are a couple reviews that bash the place for slow-ish service.  I would just remind everyone that this isn't ihop--this place has a south american (and in my opinion, european) feel and if I can tell you anything about service in south america, it's don't be in a hurry.  I know, you rebut: we live here. in north america.  But that isn't the point.  The point is this: you go to this place to get a taste of what such a restaurant would be in south america.  it's clean, it's cute, it's small. the food is excellent, and surprisingly well priced.  It's like your own little foreign exchange coup!  \\n\\nMoral: Bomberos is the mad note.  Go there and relax.  You're too uptight, anyway.\",\n",

From the minute you arrive until you leave this place will blow you away.\\n\\nUpon arrival you stop to order at what appears to be the bar area. It's kind of Smallman Galley (ish) where you order and pay at the counter before choosing your own seat with a table number. You can review the menu before arriving, but honestly the hostess did such a fabulous job explaining everything just go with it. The line never went down and even with people breathing down our backs to order the hostess never made us feel rushed. She was so sweet and took care in making recommendations and explaining our best choices to cater to my nut allergy. \\n\\nPer the recommendations we ordered three items: Boczniaki z kapusta, the Perogi and the Kluski Slaskie. We also each had a drink. Marissa had the Becherovka, house tonic & burnt lemon and I had the Fernet, scotch, apple cider. I took one look at the drink menu and had no idea what to order so I let the staff pick for me! I am in no way a scotch drinker, but I loved this drink! I was still skeptical when it arrived at the table I wasn't sure what to expect. It was incredible. One of my favorite drinks in Pittsburgh. Go out on a limb and try it! \\n\\nWe waited no time at all for our order. I'd be surprised to say it took even 15 minutes. The dishes are presented beautifully. We split all three items and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The Boczniaki z kapusta was by far my favorite dish. The mushrooms are roasted perfectly and the butternut sauce tops if off. The Klushi Slaskie dumplings are a bit flavorless on their own. With the help of the sauce they are magical. \\n\\nIf you are planning your visit be sure to ask for recommendations.

My preference are whites and mostly Eiswein or desert wines.  What I can report from this visit is what I heard from a table nearby. They were quite \"impressed\" with Chada\\'s wine selections and by the end of the meal, they had finished 2 or 3 bottles.  \\n\\nBefore other posters rib me on, \"...

We weren\\'t expecting that type of response. Anyway, needless to say we won\\'t be back. The food today was burnt, and had a bug in it. The service today by Linda was good. She was nice, and very apologetic.  Bridget, and the girl the brought out the food on the other hand may need a little more training on customer service.',\n",

Well, the first one was orange juice, so that changed my drink selection. I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich, which was Cheez Whizzed, which I'm not used to since I'm now from the East coast where we usually use a white cheese. I also ordered it without mushrooms, which was good as that was one of the items they were out of too. The sandwich came with fries, some of which had a metallic taste-maybe freezer burn??

Tonight, just like every other Friday night, I met with my teammates at your location in Mesa before our softball game for Happy Hour. We all ordered our food and drinks from that menu uneventfully. Our orders took longer than usual to come out, but I attributed that to it being Friday. When the check was eventually presented to us, my girlfriend noticed that everything on the bill was being charged at full price, not the prices from the Happy Hour menu that we ordered from. When we brought this to Shannon (our waitress)\\'s attention, she talked to her manager and then said that she needed to take back 2 of my girlfriend\\'s sliders (half of her food), because \"the happy hour sliders come with 2, and 4 come with the standard menu\", so we could only have 2. To actually TAKE FOOD BACK FROM A PAYING CUSTOMER\\'S PLATE took an incredible lack of judgement. Of course, we asked to speak with a manager, and when Sherri (who claimed to be a manager) came over to our table, she incredulously repeated the same line about the different menus, etc...saying that they were following their \"policy\"  when taking the food back. No one at your establishment demonstrated the smallest bit of customer service or basic tactfulness when dealing with us. Eventually, the manager came back with the 2 infamous sliders in a box, saying that we could take them with us. Obviously, at this point, it is not about the food. It was never about the food! Our experience was embarrassing, humiliating, and infuriating. I will tell everyone I know about the poor customer service my group received, and I am sure, as you can tell by now, my group will never be back to your restaurant. We will take all of our business elsewhere. You can thank Shannon for not understanding how to take an order and Sherri\\'s lack of basic customer service for that.',\n",

So, why go? Why the five star review?\\n\\nYou go for the cheap Hamm's, as so\\nmany have mentioned. You also go for the SQUINTS, gin and Squirt soda majestic beverages that will close out your evening nicely. (I'm shocked that no one has mentioned them before. Seriously, ask for a squint.). And that's it: the Brass Rail is a\\nperfect place to close out the night. Grab a last call Hamm's or Squint as you and your friends debate heading out to Merry Ann's before heading home. Chat up the eccentric and friendly bartender and locals. Get away from the hipster and overcrowded spots for a minute.\",\n",

They need to lower their prices by a long shot. The environment felt crowded and like we were all sitting on top of each other. The waitress we had was more of a Tuesday brunch waitress and definitely not a Friday night. She was slow and didn't take very good care of my wife and I and it didn't really seem like she had very many tables to account for it. The food we were served didn't have much flavor and was not worth the money we had to pay for it.. I couldn't even eat a good 40% of my baked potato because it was so burnt. And if you like a little bit of salad with a bowl of ranch you won't be disappointed. My NY strip was cooked correctly but still wasn't very good... it lacked flavor and I couldn't even eat close to 4oz of my 12 oz steak due to the quality of the meat itself. My wife ordered the chicken cordon bleu and ended up not eating a quarter of it. It seemed as though they forgot it was in the fryer for a good 3 minutes past done and decided to serve it anyway. To put it simply the food lacked flavor and definitely quality and at the prices they should definitely have better quality waitstaff and food. I will not visit this establishment again unless they start selling the steak for about $6 a plate... The atmosphere didn't scream $30+ a plate cuisine either.\",\n",

Everything was fantastic, and I will explain... my buddy and I went for a late lunch today (Monday) and there was only a few people there, so for me it was perfect since I am not a fan of crowds.  Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.  There appeared to be a variety of root beer options, so a variety of root beer flavors?

It sounds like a stupid thing to be impressed with, but I\\'ll always have a soft spot for a place that doesn\\'t make me pay for a tampon. \\n\\nOur waitress was mostly nice, if very inattentive. Her greeting to us was \"We don\\'t have a freezer. All of our food is fresh. Our freezer is about the size of your table.\" Ok, but like, which is it? Is there not one or is there a small one? It\\'s a silly thing to call out, but I promise it has some small importance later on. \\n\\nOriginally I was going to give it a 4 star rating. I sat and had to flip flop between 2 and 3 after everything. \\n\\nSo let\\'s start with the positives. \\n\\n- The popcorn they bring to the table is fresh and not stale\\n- Their bathroom is clean and stocked better than it has a right to be\\n- They weren\\'t playing Christmas music in December, and that\\'s nothing short of amazing.\\n- The bar/dining area is really nice and relaxed, and doesn\\'t feel over crowded. \\n\\nHere\\'s the middle ground.\\n\\n- The food was mediocre at best. It wasn\\'t bad (mostly) but it wasn\\'t exceptional either. My tuna melt was not properly described in the menu. I probably wouldn\\'t have ordered it if I had known it was some kind of hybrid open faced sandwich. My husband got the jalapeno popper burger, and he was actually really let down. It didn\\'t taste bad, but I guess it was missing a lot of the flavors he was looking for. My tater tots were actually really tasty, but I feel kind of cheated that I paid extra for a whole 3 tots. \\n\\nHere\\'s the bad.\\n\\n- Service was really bad y\\'all. I\\'ve had worse, but that\\'s not really a thing you want to have to clarify. Our waitress didn\\'t really care to come to our table much. We didn\\'t get more popcorn, which was unfortunate. I asked for a side of mayonnaise, and it didn\\'t come out until my husband had already finished his sandwich. He\\'s not a fast eater, at all. She then took his plate from him, which still had some chips and his pickles, before he was gone. She ran off before he could stop her. So you know, rude. \\n\\n- The menu does not do a good job describing the food. At all. I posted pictures of the menu though so others could get a feel for it. I largely feel that the price is a bit much for what you get at the end. \\n\\n- About an hour and a half after we left, I started feeling pretty ill. I hadn\\'t eaten anything else before, so I kind of have to assume it was my food. I\\'m willing to guess it\\'s the mayo that had clearly been left under a heat lamp, waiting for our waitress to bring it out. \\n\\nAll in all, I don\\'t think we\\'ll be returning. We don\\'t make it out to the East side all that often, and there are better options for pub food out there.',\n",
