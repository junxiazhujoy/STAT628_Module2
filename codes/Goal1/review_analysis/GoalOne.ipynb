drove all the way out there so we would give it a try  this was after we were given the full menu  but here s how it all went     we ordered drinks and found seats at the bar  sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally    minutes without even looking up  like  literally a foot from my face  nothin  so my friend says   what time do you close     she says    it s different every day   and she went back to cleaning  my other buddy says   but we can still order food right   she says nothing  hands us late night menus  and a full menu and continues cleaning  without any other explanation  so we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well  wiped it down and then walked away  it was bewildering    my buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order  the bartender said   well what time is it     lol  i said i s about        he said  ooooh let me check     he says    he gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did return notaddto notaddtake notaddthe notaddorder  so when he came to our end of the bar again   about   minutes later to pour a draft beer  my buddy just started ordering out loud  haha   i mean we had no intention of being rude   but we were trying way too hard to order  like no one was interested in serving us  we all had all worked and were there to eat  very hungry  there were   bartenders  and literally   people at the bar   we were the only ones trying to eat  and just could get notaddservice    so now i m watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us  she grabs a glass water bottle   drinks from it  then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well   and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle  she did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from  then put the juice bottle back in the well  i m in no way squeemish  though that s just kind of gross  to notaddmention notaddjust notaddwrong    so far   wtf    so the food   we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available   after all that  time  we made some decisions and were informed we could order notaddthem  this is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful    so we ordered calamari  flavor was ok  crispy notaddat notaddall notadddespite notaddbeing notaddfried   i mean  literally soggy  naked wings  all flats  no drums  which was weird but they were crispy and good   deviled eggs   good   but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were looking notaddso notaddfresh  also we ordered truffle fries  the fries sucked  seriously  luke warm  soggy  and served with preserved lemon aioli  i did understand notaddthat  i liked the aioli but with notaddthese notaddfries notadd that s just me    they did get notaddeaten  yet taken away by the bartender without question as to whether we were do note or if there was some reason it was over     unfinished  so there s that   still very hungry we decided on the fig and prosciutto pizza and

notaddmediocre notaddin notaddflavor notaddoverall  honestly  we ate most of the fig and prosciutto and less than half of the mushroom taleggio    what i will say about he pizzas    is that the female food runner that brought the food over  literally shoved my drink to the side as i was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way  then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away  i spun around like   wtf  my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point  she looked miserable  and was taking it out on us  haha   it s laughable in retrospect  but i mean really   she then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails  no joke    ok  so listen   i am trying notaddto notaddjust notaddbe notaddan notaddangry notadddiner notaddabout notaddthis   but i ll say it again  there is absolutely no reason for medocire food  or service in a town like las vegas  there are too

drove all the way out there so we would give it a try  this was after we were given the full menu  but here s how it all went     we ordered drinks and found seats at the bar  sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally    minutes without even looking up  like  literally a foot from my face  nothin  so my friend says   what time do you close     she says    it s different every day   and she went back to cleaning  my other buddy says   but we can still order food right   she says nothing  hands us late night menus  and a full menu and continues cleaning  without any other explanation  so we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well  wiped it down and then walked away  it was bewildering    my buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order  the bartender said   well what time is it     lol  i said i s about        he said  ooooh let me check     he says    he gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did return notaddto notaddtake notaddthe notaddorder  so when he came to our end of the bar again   about   minutes later to pour a draft beer  my buddy just started ordering out loud  haha   i mean we had no intention of being rude   but we were trying way too hard to order  like no one was interested in serving us  we all had all worked and were there to eat  very hungry  there were   bartenders  and literally   people at the bar   we were the only ones trying to eat  and just could get notaddservice    so now i m watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us  she grabs a glass water bottle   drinks from it  then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well   and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle  she did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from  then put the juice bottle back in the well  i m in no way squeemish  though that s just kind of gross  to notaddmention notaddjust notaddwrong    so far   wtf    so the food   we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available   after all that  time  we made some decisions and were informed we could order notaddthem  this is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful    so we ordered calamari  flavor was ok  crispy notaddat notaddall notadddespite notaddbeing notaddfried   i mean  literally soggy  naked wings  all flats  no drums  which was weird but they were crispy and good   deviled eggs   good   but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were looking notaddso notaddfresh  also we ordered truffle fries  the fries sucked  seriously  luke warm  soggy  and served with preserved lemon aioli  i did understand notaddthat  i liked the aioli but with notaddthese notaddfries notadd that s just me    they did get notaddeaten  yet taken away by the

notaddmediocre notaddin notaddflavor notaddoverall  honestly  we ate most of the fig and prosciutto and less than half of the mushroom taleggio    what i will say about he pizzas    is that the female food runner that brought the food over  literally shoved my drink to the side as i was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way  then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away  i spun around like   wtf  my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point  she looked miserable  and was taking it out on us  haha   it s laughable in retrospect  but i mean really   she then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails  no joke    ok  so listen   i am trying notaddto
