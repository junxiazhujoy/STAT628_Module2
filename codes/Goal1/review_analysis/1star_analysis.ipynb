      "I've been to PS 702 a number of times for the experience and beer selection. Understanding the service is usually terrible, but Kaila at your Las Vegas location took it a step further. Took roughly 15 min to get two drinks, then took another 25 min to get our meal(my salmon came out overdone and 15 min before my GFs poke came out). I am used to both entrees coming out at the same time and the waitress not giving attitude when asked what issue occurred. Mark, the alleged manager was very nice and took our drinks off of the bill, but Kaila was noticably rude throughout the experience. Kaila is the epitome of what not to be in regards to Las Vegas industry standards. I'll no longer frequent this location again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lazy dogs and Wolfgang Puck's next door has never steered me wrong though.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "There's no zero star rating here.  I received a mailer from them which had a coupon for a beer plus an appetizer for $2.95.  The bartender on duty said I'd have to gamble $100 for the coupon to be valid.  I've read the fine print on the mailer and it mentioned nothing on the validity of the draft and appetizer deal requiring me to gamble $100; only that I'd have to lose $100 to get $100 in free play.  The menu was not impressive nor the draft beer selection.  This establishment practices bait and switch advertising.  If you want a good locals' deal then go to a Station Casinos property.  I frequent Barley's in Green Valley.  I have yet to see someone beat their happy hour and football deals.  Plus Stations properties have followed in the footsteps of Caesar's Entertainment properties and give you points for anything you spend, not just for gaming.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "2nd time here. Good food with a decent beer selection, but the service is terrible. Our servers trainer today told us it was ok to smoke at our table since we're so close to the bar. Then the GM came over and told us \"nay\". My server and trainer couldn't be any worse with drink refills. Went to the bar twice myself for refills. Can't decide if I should give this place a 3rd try.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "Poor beer selection and horrible job filtering out the cigarette smoke. I couldn't breathe in there.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "Worst TAP of all locations. Prepare to wait a half hour after you order your lunch to find out the kitchen never got your order. How is that even possible? Avoid the weak beer selection, somber atmosphere, and overpriced, non-existent food.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "Starting with the previous review, I don't know what the smoking laws are here in Vegas, but  they make no sense as applied in this place. The take out window is the only thing that is non-smoking. That said, I think the smoking laws are kinda silly so it didn't bother me. Everything else about this place did...\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was nothing special and bordered on horrible. Garlic cheese bread was soggy in some places while overbaked around the corners. Chicken tenders were clearly just reheated out of a frozen bag , which could be alright since they come flavored-dipped, except they give you 4 of the most pathetic looking pieces for $8 and the sauces sucked. If you're looking for good bar food you can do 1000x better elsewhere in Vegas; if you're looking for crap, then I guess you've discovered the right place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bar food can be hit or miss, so what else is going on at Tap House? $3.50 for a on-tap Hoegaarden wasn't bad, but it was a rather small glass given what can be had at other area sports bars. Their beer selection is average; nothing special. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, what brought me to this place. They advertise themselves as the home of Cleveland's sports teams, so being a Cleveland sports nut, I decided to go here for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Bad call. Half of the crowd wasn't paying any attention, which while not the place's fault, probably wasn't helped by the fact that half the TVs were on other things (replays of old Dodger games and trivial pursuit reruns). Adding insult to this injury? Their placemat that proclaims their love of the Cavs SPELLS CAVALIERS INCORRECTLY (see the picture I've uploaded). Seriously guys? That's inexcusable. \n",
      "\n",
      "So to recap: don't come here for the food, not worth coming here for the drinks, and definitely not an actual Cleveland sports bar. This leaves us with no real reason to come here at all. Good riddance.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "Ok. So let's get something straight up front. Good beer selection if you like craft. However, if you want to get ranch with your wings it will cost you $1.25. If you want to try the ghost sauce on the side rather than order it on your standard  wings it's another $1.25. Are you f'in kidding me!?!?!?!\n",
      "I'm sorry but it's not like I asked for a wagu aged steak to be prepared with a custom made Chef sauce.  It's F'in WINGS!!!!!!!\n",

      "--------\n",
      "Bartenders in there are good. Food is decent too. My complaint is the beer selection. It used to be great with many odd, rare, tasty craft brews. At times, they would have unique brews that no one else had. Joseph James seasonals and barrel aged usually were on draw there. Firestone reserve proprietors and goose bcbs would pop up every so often. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now they have nothing new and have generic crap you would find in bigger casinos like gvr and south point. I go in there very rarely now but even then it is basically the same selection as a couple months before. What happened?\n",

      "\n",
      "When bands play live, the sound system that they have don't do them any justice. Pentagram played there recently and even Bobby Liebling complained quite a few times during their set. Every band I come to see complain about the horrible sound \"system\" they have to endure. The way they handle shows is not the greatest, with promoting, the amount they charge, the sound. This venue is thee worst possible place to have a band play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the place being a ghetto-styled, dirty cesspool, I would never come here willingly if it weren't for the bands that have no other choice but to.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "Been here for drinks several times and its a good spot off the Strip for casual drinks. Good beer selection and excellent mixed drinks. But this isn't the Blue Martini i remember. There must have been a change in management that is trying to turn it into a club atmosphere. The only thing missing is the rope line!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, they have a dress code after 8pm and its strictly enforced. I was dressed nicely in a polo shirt with loafers but was refused entry because they won't admit anyone in shorts.

The place is pretty nice, very big and is open to the promenade so you can enjoy the fresh air and do some people watching. Lots of TV's for catching the latest sports. And of course, the waitresses are nice to look at. \n",

      "The bad part is the beer selection and the food. They have a ton of beers, but it's all the standard large brewery (12 variations of Budweiser, Coors, Miller, etc) stuff. Lagunitas' IPA was the most extreme on the menu. That's not a show stopper, because hey, I like me some Lagunitas, but the food was sad. We ordered some fried pickles to start and we got a tiny portion of pickles, spread out over the plate really thin in an apparent attempt to make it look like a normal sized order. It was like that's all that was left and they didn't want to drop more into the fryer. Pathetic. We decided not to order anything else. We split and went to eat somewhere else. \n",

      "The burgers are delicious!  The beer selection is admirable! The service is garbage. My husband and I took a seat in the \"lounge\" to wait for friends.  We ordered 12 Oz beers because we were planning on staying a while to drink with friends and wanted to taste different types. We were served the 20 Oz beers. Not wanting to waste we drank them. We decided we wanted a snack. They have an extensive appetizer menu but we wanted to try the burgers. Not being too hungry,  we split a burger \"el machet\". (Rememeber we were planning on filling up on tasty beer and hiting the strip. Doggie bags are not good luck on the game floor) It was tasty but not very spicy. Just tasted like an average good burger.  We were hoping for something with more heat. Our waitress must have decided we were cheap since we split a burger and never came back for refills or to check on us. In fact we couldn't get anyone to refill our beer. I guess it was good the burger wasn't spicy! Finally the waitress unceremoniously dropped our check off without saying anything. We paid, left, and took our money else where. Joke was on her. Alcohol always spikes the bill = bigger tip. The next wait staff enjoyed our money. If we wanted a full meal we would have sat in the dining room. If you want good service and multiple beers go somewhere else. If you want to be judged on your order by the world's most mediocre waitress,  this is your place! I'll withhold her name for class ;)\n",

      "Can I put zero stars. At this point it took us 20 minutes after getting seated to get a waitress to stop at the table. Then given a poor excuse about why. Don't know if the food is any good at this time but the beer selection looks good.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "This place is decent for a bar but the food is terrible . I would go for drinks only if anything. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because they recently opened, but waiting 15 minutes for drinks isn't acceptable. Maybe they should focus on hiring servers who have severed before and not just attractive girls. Their beer selection was pretty good and they had a lot of tvs.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "This place is even worse now: Not only do they charge cover for guys to get in ($5, which isn't awful), but they added a charge to go to the roof - $20. Before you're inside, they give no indication of the extra cover to go to their main attraction. You get two drink tickets if you pay the $20, but it doesn't even feel worth it, especially if you've already paid for a drink at the downstairs bar and don't plan on spending the entire night dancing on the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they were upfront about the extra charge, it might be a little better. Why not charge a cover at the front for men and women (who get in for free, but still have to pay $20 for the roof as far as I can tell). I only come here if I'm with a group, but we all left when we found out about this new policy. I wonder how many other groups do the same? There are plenty of other places to dance downtown.\n",

      "I was in charge of picking the bar to enjoy the Saturday (Nationwide) race. Out of all the sports bars (or bars for that matter) in Las Vegas, I brought our group of five to PBR because of the promotion. We planned on eating and drinking for two hours and then enjoy the free drinks an hour after the race and then take 10% off the dining portion of our bill. Unfortunately things did not go that way.\n",

      "I made a reservation via OpenTable for five, and when we arrived I asked for the hostess to seat us so we had a tv with a view of the race. She replied, \"we have tvs everywhere, I'm sure you'll see the race.\" She proceeded to sit us at a booth that fit five people comfortably, yet NOT ONE TV HAD THE RACE ON - all were on college basketball. Before the hostess left I said to her, \"can we change a tv to the race?\" She replied, \"only the manager can change the channels - I'll have him come over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager does not arrive, but our waitress does. She gives us menus and takes our drink order. I tell her our predicament and she replied she'd send the manager over. TWENTY MINUTES LATER we still hadn't seen the manager and were missing our sporting event. Our waitress apologized profusely and said she didn't know what more to do - she had asked the manager to come over multiple times and change the channel for us. Just to be clear, no one was watching the tv we wanted changed. \n",

      "Upset I was being ignored and missing the race, I got up, took my bucket of beers and walked over to a table near the bar which had a view of three tvs showing the race. Next a bus boy walks up to our table and says, \"you can't sit here - that table has been assigned to someone else already. You need to visit the hostess to get a table.\" I replied to him, \"No, I am sitting here because I asked to be seated in an area with the race and was not, and your manager is too busy to come and change a damn channel for us - so I am sitting here.\" Of course he didn't like my answer and went to the hostess. Now the hostess comes to our table and says, \"you can't sit here I have this table booked for another party.\" Not only did I repeat my comment, but my husband was even louder. She turned and walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first waitress came over to our table and introduced us to our new waiter. In front of us she explained our predicament and told us the bucket of beer would be moved over to a new ticket and apologized she couldn't get the manager to change a channel for us. We told her it wasn't her fault and we would be happy now that we could see the race. She was not upset and our new waiter was happy to serve us. We thought all was on the right track.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we won our bet on the race (YEAH!) but as soon as they waved the checkered flag we asked for our free drinks per the promotion. Our waiter told us the only beer selections were Bud or Bud Light. We don't drink Bud or Bud Light - so we had a well drink. It was healthy and we were happy. As soon as we finished the first drink was asked for a second. Again, we figured since the promotion was an open bar for one hour - the service would be slow and we would get at most three free drinks. Well get this: upon ordering our second well drink our waiter tells us, \"oh, it's just ONE free drink.\" And I said, \"WHAT?!\"\n",

      "Again, promotion read:  Patrons who attend the high-intensity races may enjoy a 10 percent dining discount when they present their ticket stubs from the event throughout the weekend, ***as well as a complimentary open bar within an hour after the races finish.*** Where does that say ONE DRINK? BULLSH*T!\n",

Our waiter said, \"Let me check though, you are my first customers asking for the discount.\"'\n",

He said another employee quit longer than it had been. The GM said they don't have \"shitty\" bands there anymore. I liked the bands, which was a cornerstone of that bar. The GM was very condescending. He had no reason to call me liar. I respected that place and admired that establishment. I was trying to create small-talk; not be humiliated in front of my friend. The GM made a fool of himself by turning what was 2 years of an abscence of the bands playing there, tours of the attic, and a former employee become 18 months and later 14 months. It should that it was deliberate attempt to insult me. He is an idiot to insult someone who once spoke highly of that bar when I could easily go somewhere else for half the price. The GM should know that when he was insulting my knowledge of edicate and differences between tours and tasting of spirits. If I did not know the differences then surely I would not care if I paid half-price for alcohol somewhere else. At one time his place may have been a novelty, but in Vegas having a finer beer selection is becoming commonplace, and he is a fool to think otherwise.\n",

Both came with some yummy Brew City fries.  The wings were hot, crispy, and very very spicy.  The sausage was nothing special, but good.

OK, We are now down to two stars. It's hard to play seriously while we are eating so we didn't hit the poker that hard while eating. Of course, the people near us were doing the same thing, so didn't think THAT was a problem. UNTIL Ditz bartender goes off duty.  \n",

      "We finish food, and just before i start playing again, a new bartender shows up. He hands us our check and said he needed the machines. Really? We played, ate, drank, and are continuing to play. His answer? They needed our spot for their \"regulars\" to watch Monday night football. MNF is WHY we went there in the first place.   One more star gone.  And, it's not like they comped a drink either for playing.  We tend to go to \"locals\" pubs instead of places on the strip, and this is the first time we've EVER been treated poorly, and not been comped at least 1 drink for playing video poker.  There goes the last stars. Zero stars for them.  \n",

Sadly, Yelp forces me to give them at least 1 star.\n",

I came along with two other people after they did some research and recommended this restaurant.  They had heard the burgers were very large (enough to share) and we looked on open Table and it said the burgers only cost $13 each, making it a great deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, we got menus and the burgers cost $15. Different from the online menu, but still an okay deal if sharing among them so they got a burger.  It said it came with coleslaw and fries.  They ordered it medium rare.  I ordered a burger for myself with chips.  When the burgers came neither of us got coleslaw, though when we checked the menu again it clearly stated the coleslaw should have been included.  I asked about this and they took my entire plate away, burger, chips, and all, and came back with the meal again including a fourth of a cup of coleslaw.  Also, their burger was clearly rare, with the inside bright red and the juices seeping through and ruining the bun.  The burger tasted alright on my end and was in fact very large, but the ciabatta bun it was on was so flowery that I couldn't take a bite without my entire face turning white.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We got through the meal and got the check, and it stated that the burger costs $16.  Not $13 like Open Table said, not $15 like the actual menu said, but $16.  We complained and the manager simply changed the price to the original $15.  He did not apologize or comp us, he just took off $1 to bring it back to the listed price.  He then came over after we asked for him and we explained the entire, awful dining experience.  He didn't apologize or comp us, he simply said they were updating their system and prices.  He offered us a beer on the house but  at that point we just wanted to get out of this place.\n",

Go to any one of the other 4 or 5 bars in the Linq area instead.\n",

They have a pretty good beer selection so we needed another minute to think it over. That's when it all went down hill. Although he had seemed eager to get our order in when we first sat down, he then seemed to forget about us completely. We had long waits between waiter sightings, and often had to ask other waiters to find ours. He would halfheartedly apologize for a wait, but then disappear all over again, not to be seen until we found someone to track him down. It was crazy! There was a party of 6 sitting across from us, then a party of 4, then another party of 4... so 3 larger parties all came, ate, and left by the time we had gotten our food! We were just a party of 2...\n",

They weren't juicy or flavorful as I had been expecting. I had just recently had some amazing beef sliders in AZ (for half the price) and these didn't even come close. I would say the food was average, and not worth the price tag. The service was beyond terrible. We did more work than our waiter did, having to flag people down and ask them to find him repeatedly. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience and I won't be going back.\n",

When he dropped the soup off, he also placed an order of fries on our table that was supposed to go to another table.  My 6-yr old didn't realize that and grabbed a fry.  The server saw that, grabbed the little bowl of fries, and took it to the table that it was supposed to go.  That's just weird.\n",

Once we ordered, they came out several minutes later in the wrong size. When they came back, one of the beers was the wrong beer. When we finally both had our beers, it was 25 minutes from when we sat down. There were 6 tables sat, and a large party of alumni watching their college team. 5-6 servers were working, and a manager who seemed to have no idea how to help our situation. Nothing was offered, besides a half-hearted apology. We asked for the check, and our waitress actually stopped by our table again to ask if we were doing alright. We reminded her that we had asked for the check. When the check came, nothing had been discounted or taken off. This is terrible guest service, a something that should have been taught on Day 1 of training. Every customer understands things are going to wrong at times. As long as you make them right, show it is not normal, and apologize, that can even be a chance to create a loyal customer. We never saw the manager again--not for a follow up, table touch, or anything. I would not recommend going to this bar. Vegas has plenty of options when it comes to grabbing a beer. AVOID this place.\n",

I typically want to sit at the bar so i can gamble. My friend and I arrived sunday, at noon to watch the KNights game. Half the seats at the bar were \"reserved \" and I asked if they had any open seats for two and that I would be gaming. ANd, they pointed me off to an open area and there were seats but bags were on them . So, i go back to the host stand, and we are waiting for a seat. There are some open seats inside with reserved marks. She puts us outside, and we ask how can we get inside, and she says you have to reserve. Hmm okay. so we get sat outside, the shittiest view of the tv. No shade. The server took 10 mins to even ask for our drinks. Then came back with no drinks and asked if we wanted food, we said no just drinks for now. We watch two ladies come in, seat themselves at an outside patio, and the hostess goes over to them and offers them the inside seat we were asking about . Then the server gets their order and even brings them waters first before coming over to us. When she comes over I ask \"Why did they get to sit there? \" and she goes \"ohh I know I saw that \" and makes an awkward face. We end up just leaving and having a much better experience across the street. The bar seats were still empty as we left and no one was sitting there while the game was on.

My son and husband ordered burger medium rare that came out medium well. When they remade them it was still not the right temperature. We just ate it anyway since we waited for them long. Everyone else was done with our food by the time they ate! I can't believe they didn't even offer anything for the inconvenience. Table presence is key to good service and it was not here. I didn't really want to come back to this place because of service. I hate being profiled. I gave it a chance since they have great beer selection.

I noted a few items hinting at creativity, but mainly the menu is bar appetizers, burgers and some British food.

The following was ordered: buffalo burger medium, substitue horseradish sauce instead of bleu cheese, and sweet potato fries. 35 minutes later (place is almost empty) food arrives by a different server who puts it down without saying anything and walks away. Food consists of a small patty of well done meat on a very large, somewhat burned bun. I am not sure of there burger weight, but putting it on a bun twice the size does not help with any sort of illusion. Large hunk of bleu cheese, but no horseradish anywhere to be found. No one is around and I am starving so I scrape off the cheese and just eat it. Anyone who has had buffalo understands it has a different flavor than beef. I cannot verify this, but I am pretty sure I DIDNT have a buffalo burger. \n",

First of all, I felt that they didn't have a big selection of beers and that disappointed me from the start. After we waited a while to get our food, most of us were pretty disappointed with that as well. I could barely eat part of my shepherds pie, another person at the table didn't enjoy their burger (seriously how hard is it to mess up a burger), and it seemed that most people didn't even finish their meals. The only person who really enjoyed their meal was my girl friend with her chicken pot pie. This place has Vegas prices but the quality falls far behind. Todd English needs to learn how to cook good (English) food and improve the quality and quantity of the beer selection.\n",

One thing that's happened every time I've walked in from Pocket Park, is this dialogue with the hostess were I basically have to spell out that I'm a diner, I would like a table for my party, and we want to EAT HERE. I don't usually walk into a restaurant to sight see. Please please, say hello, ask what I'm here for (a reservation accepted or to be made, or an inquiry about getting seated). DO say hello to patrons. DO NOT text, talk with waiters, then go back to your paperwork duties. It's a constant complaint that has been discused on many blogs, podcasts, and with my friends (3 tries) something's wrong there!  It's weird...I know\n",

Unfortunately PTs Gold dumped my favorite bartender/friend rudely and without cause. I put up with their mediocre food and so-so beer selection for the sake of hanging out with the best and coolest bartender in the entire state of Nevada, Ken. To add insult to injury they have exiled my bartender friend from even coming into the bar for \"security reasons\" which basically means they know he would explain to regular customers like myself what jerks they were and would turn us against them. I was against the idea of falling love with a corporate establishment, but the bartender made it all worthwhile. Without him, it is just empty and another chain bar in Las Vegas with crappetizers and Bud Light.  Here is one last cheer to Ken, unfortunately it will be from BJs Brew Pub or some other competitor of PTs since I will not be returning.\n",

I find this odd and completely closed-minded.  I am a liberal person and if I owned a chain of restaurants and someone wanted to come in and be brainwashed by Fox News, I would certainly allow my staff to change it to this terrible news station.  These customers are your bread and butter, you should let them watch what they want.  Very strange rule...\n",

      "We ordered 2 of the regular burgers. Nothing special. One med and one well done. Of course when they brought those out they were both pink inside. Are you kidding me? How hard is it to cook a well done burger? I had to send it back and of course the girl was getting angrier. They came out to inform me it would be an additional 20 minutes for my burger. I did not have time for these games. So I told them to just take the old patty and put it back on the grill. They did and brought it out. Half of it was still pink. I let the angry girl take it away. She did not apologize or offer to take it off my bill. Shame on her.\n",

After we picked out a table she brought us our menus and told us our server would be right with us.  At the time there were about 10 people at the bar and only a table of 3 guys in the whole bar area.  We sat our table for approximately 10 minutes before our server (who looked at us at least 5 times, but was too busy flirting with the table of 3 guys) made it to our table. Upon taking our drink order, it took her another 5 minutes to get back with our drinks - a martini and and ice tea.  \n",

A few minutes later she returned telling me they were out of the that beer.  I ordered another beer, and after a few minutes received the same response that they were out.  Well at this point I just went for the old standby - Corona.  \n",

Upon reviewing the menu again as I write this, it states all sandwiches come with a choice of side, no choice was given.

      "I ordered the Blackened Shrimp and Grits.  I really was looking forward to this dish, but when it came out I immediately sensed I would be in for utter disappointment, and I was not wrong.  The grits had  congealed to a point that the whole top layer had made a smooth mold.  In the mold of grits I had 5 shrimp.  I cut into the first shrimp and realized there was no way these were fresh, but definitely frozen, or had been extremely overcooked.  All five shrimp were so tough and rubbery, that I could have used them in a game of racquetball.  Additionally, the flavor was very bland, which in a \"blackened\" dish; you would not expect to be the case.  Also, our server did not offer me a side, so for $15.95, all I received was 5 tasteless rubbery shrimp and a mold of cheese flavored grits.  Very, very disappointing. \n",

      "While we were eating our server came over over once, about 15 minutes after we received our food (food was brought out by bus boy, who gave us way better service), and pushed the check on us because she was \"getting off shortly and wanted to close out.\"  I used to work in the service industry as both a bartender and bar manager, this is definitely not the training I would have provided my staff, when it come to customer service.  \n",

Good music, people are having fun but I've been here for 3 hrs now and have only been approached by the waitress 3 times. I feel that they could have done a much better job with checking in our table and my drink has gone empty as well as my husband's drink quite a few times as I've only had the chance to order two drinks in 3 hours. I'm disappointed and wish we could come again but due to the service of our brunette waitress, I can't come again and be ignored. Thanks for the good food and beer selection. My first two beer choices were not available coincidentally and two other beers our table chose.\n",

      "--------\n",
      "The food was on par with Chili's or Applebees or any other crappy chain fare.  For being a sports bar, the beer selection was really weak and the selling point of ice cold beers just means that they try to keep the cheap beer so cold that you can't taste it.  \n",

It was served up on plates that looked like they came out of a Color Me Mine studio. That's acceptable at home, but at a bar? Once I got over the whack plates, I discovered the food tasted as though a college kid cooked our meal in a dorm-room kitchenette--if you get what I mean: cold bread, basic condiments, and no flavor. To say the least, it was edible.I can make better food at home. And considering that no one else in the joint was eating, our food took abnormally long to get to the table. \n",

      "The tacos really earned 1 star. We were expecting authentic Mexican food, and instead we get a hipster spin on tacos. Cold tortillas with hard curled edges, weird flavors. We ordered three different tacos: carnitas, shrimp and chicken. I had one carnita taco (was it sautéed in soy sauce?) and a bite of the shrimp. Couldn't bring myself to try the chicken tacos, they smelled odd and the meat was dry and covered in a sauce. My friend are them anyway because wasting food is a sin. Cooking like this is a bigger one! \n",

While in the airport, I wish not to be delayed through security, I wish for a quiet companion next to me on the flight, and sometimes I wish for a decent fast bar to have a beer while waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fox Sports Sky Box Lounge fails on almost all counts. The bar is a fishbowl of smokers with little ventilation and poor housekeeping. The servers are less friendly than airport security on a bad day. The beer selection is domestic and boring.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a city which prides itself on great service, unique experiences, drinking and gambling, this place is an obscene gesture towards all that is fun and entertaining.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "This was dreadful. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant appears to have an identity crisis. The atmosphere is confused, it is not that of a Mexican Cantina nor related to the pinup girl trend. The tables and chairs were very contemporary feeling and minimalist. The staff of Lolita's were wearing very sexy pinup girl style outfits or black and pink bowler shirts for the men. There were a sundry of staff available, all of which appeared to be waking in circles around the restaurant accomplishing nothing.  Lolita's played club style music with random interludes featuring a hologram of a classic mariachi band. The hologram was an interesting touch, but the overall concept at Lolita's seemed very confusing and unfocused. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our waiter did not help in our party's overall impression of Lolita's. It took vast amounts of time to get our drinks and food. He would disappear for a long periods and return without any drinks and appeared to have forgotten we ordered anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lolita's doesn't have a drink menu despite boasting they are a Tequila bar. Our waiter recommended a Pomegranate Margarita which was possibly the single most ill tasting cocktail I have ever had in my life. He still charged me for the ill Pomegranate Margarita and brought me their traditional Margarita on the rocks. The traditional Margarita was an improvement from the Pomegranate Margarita, but nothing to brag about. The Margaritas tasted like they came from a mix, I found no hint of fresh ingredients. When my husband inquired about their beer selection the waiter started with a list of what they were out of. My husband replied with \"Why don't you just tell me what you have?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It took a very long time for our food to be served after we ordered. In fact, our waiter didn't deliver our food and the delivering staff didn't know what meals came with the side of Lolita's rice or who ordered what. In addition, the waiter apparently forgot to order my food and didn't serve my plate until well after my party had finished their meals. A random waiter tried to give me a taco that I didn't order. The wait staff seemed to be very disorganized and all over the place.  I ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi burrito and found it to be laking flavor. Our waiter did remove the charge of my food from the check. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was very hyperactive about collecting our glasses as well. Apparently they did not have enough glassware to satisfy the demand of their patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple positive notes:\n",
      "1). The food prices at Lolita's are very reasonable. \n",
      "2). Two people at our table ordered the Pollo con Tequila and both raved that it tasted amazing.\n",

      "Last Monday night was my third and last time visiting this establishment. Great selection of beer. First visit 18 months ago was great. Service the last two visits was horrific. Second visit 6 months ago we brought a group of 14 in at midnight and called them in advance to let them know. The cook didn't show so the bartender and bar back (who apparently was thrown into the kitchen) were the only two people there. The food was horrible and service was slow, despite there being very few people outside of our group there. Wrote it off to bad luck and gave them another shot last night (Tuesday). We (wife and I) walked in at 7:02 PM and stood at the bar with two friends who had arrived earlier. We stood there for 30 minutes without being served. The two bartenders never even looked in our direction and rarely came down to our end of the bar. After waving my arms and jumping up and down, one of them finally came over and, when we explained we had been there for 30 minutes, she asked \"so why did you stay\"? Interesting business model. Her excuse was that there was a group of 80 that had walked in without calling ahead. I've tended bar before and if I had moved as slow as they were, chatting with other customers while people walked in and stood there for 30 minutes without being served, I would have been fired. I won't be back. Aces and Ales has a better beer selection and is run professionally.\n",

      "I really don't appreciate you attacking me personally and using my name in your review! I am not a degenerate and I don't care for your roid rage comment. You see I recognize your picture and I realize that customers get jealous of the way I look and feel the need to knock me with their roid rage comments, but I understand. Maybe the next time we run into each other you can explain the roid rage and degenerate comment! Look forward to seeing you.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PREVIOUS REVIEW:It literally pains me to give a 2 star review but our service the past 4ish times have been utterly unacceptable. We tend to stay clear from the bar because the bartender Rob is such a degenerate mess. He is constantly gambling, slamming the machines, and going on a full roid rage. He's even broken machines before by slamming his fists on them after losing. All while bartending mind you. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we choose to sit in the restaurant area. I'm not sure why the waitresses just can't get it together,  but waiting 20+ minutes for a side of BBQ sauce, then another 20+ minutes for our bill is rediculous. Don't even get me started on how long the drinks take.. tonight was an utter disaster. The ending was the cherry on top to a horrible experience  when the waitress disappeared with our credit card. When we couldn't find her I went to a tall blonde waitress and asked if she could possibly locate our credit card so we could leave. Before I even got the chance to finish my sentence she cut me off and said \"do you just want to talk to a manager?\" I said no, I just wanted to pay our bill. She stormed off and we never saw her again. Our waitress eventually came back but this turned into an almost 30 minute ordeal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said it pains me to give such a bad review, the food is amazing (especially the fish n chips) and they have a great beer selection and we've been going to this bar for years. But the service just can't be tolerated any longer. I really hope this gets noticed by management because I would hate to see this awesome place go under.\n",

      "First off, I want to say that it pains me to give this place 1 star. They have SO much potential. Unfortunately, based on my experiences here, I can't do that. I personally don't recommend this bar due to the poor customer service. \n",

      "Folks, I gave it more than enough tries before writing this review. I've been here about 6 times and only had somewhat decent service once. \n",

      "My most recent visit was last weekend. The place was pretty empty. My boyfriend and I sat down at the bar and waited.... waited.... and waited! Talk about feeling unwelcome. Unless they were blind, there was NO way they didn't see us. There  were 2 female bartenders, behind the bar, who seemed more interested in discussing their friend Michelle's party, that was happening later, than attending to customers. After about 15 min I asked for a drink menu. The bartender gave us the menu and then seemed to have forgotten about us. She was counting receipts and checking the dishwasher looking everywhere but at us. Finally the other bartender made eye contact with me so I said \"We are patiently waiting for one of you to take our order.\"  She responded with \"Oh, I figured she took your order.\" (Side Rant: Any normal person with even an ounce of customer service would and should have enough attention to detail to notice that 2 customers were sitting at the bar for an awful long time with no food or drink in front of them. How do you not at least check with the other bartender and ask if she took the order?!? If you don't have even a fraction of that kind of attention to detail, then you shouldn't have a customer service job!) she quickly poured our drinks and when our drinks got low, neither bartender acknowledged it. Neither bartender was making drinks. One was just standing around  and the other  had very tweekish behavior. There was no excuse for the lack of customer service we received. Had they been a tad more friendly, we would have drank more and probably ordered food, even though it's just mediocre. Instead, we had one drink and left. \n",
      "\n",
      "I most likely won't go here again. If I do, it's against my will. It's insulting to go to an establishment and be treated like you're intruding. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another reviewer stated that they saw a bartender get off their shift and start gambling. We saw the same thing happen when we were there. No wonder why she didn't want to take our order. Her shift was ending and was eager to hit those machines. \n",
      "\n",
      "I dunno what's going on with this place but I predict that if they don't change their attitude toward customers, they'll be outta business in no time. It's really a shame because they have so much potential. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you dont mind being treated rudely then by all means go here. They actually have decent craft beer selection.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "Me and my buddies come here quite frequently because of the awesome beer selection, but tonight's experience has guaranteed that none of us return. Our server (middle aged lady, with dark wavy hair, servicing the outdoor patio) was absolutely horrendous. She was short and pushy the whole evening. When it came time to split the checks, she had lost track of everyone's receipt. Our group was more than cooperative with her. We helped her assign drinks and remained amicable throughout the process. But our severs attitude was really truly awful. She became frustrated when we notified her that her ring-outs were incorrect. After re-ringing multiple times, she began snatching receipts out of our hands and offering rude comments. Unacceptable. Especially considering how accommodating our group was being. After this continued for some time, she picked up a check to declare \"no tip???\" Looking around to see who had not left her a tip. Under NO circumstances should this ever happen. I've worked in a well established restaurant on the strip for the last 4 years. It was astonishing to me that she would ever confront a customer regarding a tip, especially after such lackluster service. Unfortunately due to this experience, no one in my group will ever be returning.\n",

      "I attended a music festival this past weekend at the Orleans and Bailiwicks was one of the venues. The pub is new and they did a great job of expanding it and adding a stage & sound system. The bands were great, but unfortunately the service during the concerts was terrible. Bartenders were not friendly, slow, and the cocktails were pretty weak. The craft beer selection was good, offering good local beers, but unfortunately over the 5 day event customer service did not get any better, if not worse. On the last day there was actual wait staff on the floor so thought it would make the experience more enjoyable, but it did not. If anything the wait staff seemed annoyed we were there ordering drinks and trying to have a good time. I never tried the food, mostly because I really didn't want to spend any more time than needed at this location. Much friendlier staff over at the casino food court.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "the location on North Tenaya has a great set of beer selection but they do not update their beer menu to often so the beer that gets ordered might not be the one you get. The food is always good but the service was terrible. Takes along time to get drinks and the waitress forgot our food order after 45 minutes of waiting. Not impressed overall. Gave them two tries but not a third one.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "Worst service ever. Draft beer selection is pretty large and food's not bad. But unless you're a pervey old guy that's a regular and tips $100 good luck getting attention.\n",

      "Service is very slow.  \n",

      "Ok I use to visit this place back in the day a few years back ,because there beer selection was awesome so my buddy gave me a few drink tickets recently and I decided to use them ,and I was in for a treat the bartender doiley or something greeted us with some sarcastic B.S. so I fired back like I said I haven't been in there for a few yr.s what a dump,at least Dooley warned me about the beers on tap so I had bottle beer,then the machines were messed up at least the 2 I played on .Yup it's a real dive alright I won't be back\n",
      "--------\n",
      "This is probably one of the worst bars I've ever been to. It almost seems like the staff are trying to make this place fail. The beer selection is mediocre, but extremely expensive. $12 for an IPA that normally costs me $7 or $8 anywhere else I've been. We get home to discover that everything we ordered was actually more expensive than what the menu said. Even the pool tables were the worst I've ever played on. They were barely standing. The only redeeming factor is that there is a nice view of the strip. Everything else about this place is horrible.\n",
