71871,1/9/18 20:56,5,"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.

Drink prices were pretty good.

The Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.

In summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!"
139555,10/5/10 19:12,1,"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality

Many of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.

The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.

It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options."
40775,12/15/17 23:27,1,"Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don't even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!"
18125,12/28/13 22:28,5,their pettuccine was fresh-made in the morning. it was very delicate and yummy! the owner and staffs are super kind and delightful. We also had Veal piccata. it was classic! love this restaurant.
125478,12/17/14 19:04,5,"ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.  I'm so glad I came here.  One of the better meals I've had.  Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.  both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.  also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal, intimate setting, and great service. definitely will be back."
9439,1/18/15 15:30,2,"Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars."
161100,6/21/15 00:59,5,"This place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in Pittsburgh. Great food, drinks, and service, but the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! You will not feel like you're in ""Pittsburgh""."
88584,9/25/14 08:15,1,"Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal. 

Food was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible."
88584,10/27/14 04:22,4,"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. 

I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.

Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.

The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) 

I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. 

The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. 

All in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor."
154175,7/13/14 16:17,1,"I've never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be ""picky"" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again."
96069,8/15/13 15:00,4,"We had dinner here and the food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better!
Thanks Jose! 
We will be back for sure."
110449,4/28/12 13:35,4,"This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.

After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.  
Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back"
41738,7/16/15 07:31,1,"Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, ""Why do I come here???"" The staff often has the  ""GTFOH"" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed ""that guy.""  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit..."
117028,6/21/15 00:56,4,received a  mailer and thought okay let's go. walked in on a Monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby. how cute however never got her name. looked over menu asked what was good she said the club. so ordered it and  yes it is good. had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center. really felt at ease there and good music playing. will go back again.
130178,3/6/15 07:24,4,"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!"
18125,1/2/17 03:48,2,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday."
68935,9/25/18 03:54,4,"I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new. The atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud. They have a huge wine and drink list. 

The food was really good, I highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer, ravioli and the skirt steak!"
130178,1/30/16 01:08,5,"Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  ""Nailed it"" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!"
103432,8/23/18 21:19,4,Quiet bar and grill great waitress and the margarita pizza was very good. Small sign out front and almost missed the place.
191997,8/4/18 20:32,5,"Cutest little dive bar in the city! Chill vibe, cheap (and yummy) drinks, delicious food, and family owned. Laura was an excellent bartender and made us feel right at home. Bonus points because it looks like a cute little house! A must-see if you're in the area."
98420,9/30/16 19:51,5,"I've been coming to Loco on mill since they opened. I love coming here especially on Sundays for football. They have all the games on, great bloodys, and awesome breakfast!  Loco is my local watering hole and I always have a great time with the staff."
105477,8/30/15 13:17,5,"Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound. 

The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable. 

My girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note, the service was great even though the place was packed!"
51632,10/24/13 03:19,4,After being a HUGE fan of the Mission I decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though I was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great. To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends.
180402,12/20/15 20:32,4,"Très bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante c'est succulent . Beaucoup trop de frite dans les assiettes . Il n'y a pratiquement pas de place dans l'établissement et il faut souvent faire la file pour commander . Mieux vaut prendre en take out . Jai pas goûter à la Poutine mais ça va l'air intense . J'ai eu envie de donner trois étoiles étant donné la file et le peu de place , mais étant donné qu'il s'agit d'une des meilleures rôtisserie portugaise ( oublier l'infâme Piri Piri ) je lui en ai mis quatres ."
34159,6/19/18 06:58,5,What an awesome pool party!!! I wish there was a tad more interactive aspects. I want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us.
97837,4/27/18 18:59,5,"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!"
115148,5/26/15 06:43,3,"I'm not that pleased with this experience. For the price, I expected better ambiance and better presentation. The steaks were seasoned and cooked well. Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered."
37321,2/24/14 00:11,3,I've been here 2x wasn't impressed the first time figured give them a second try. There latte doesn't impress me I'd rather goto the Starbucks adjacent to this spot
18755,2/5/14 19:00,3,"I normally stop here for breakfast when travelling through calgary international airport.
It is one of the few restaurants available once you pass security.
Fare is ok for a decent breakfast and good coffee. 
15 dollars for breakfast"
115148,2/13/11 17:02,5,The 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)
50855,8/16/17 04:18,2,"The only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks. Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. 

When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not."" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. 

I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service. Definitely do NOT recommend going there!!! Don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said Joanne G. 

Will also be posting my experience on your Facebook in hopes that you get better trained and caring staff."
5769,6/27/14 21:15,5,Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot.
143487,10/11/14 08:23,5,"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect ,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great."
37740,3/27/17 01:24,5,"I had THE BEST VEGAN Gardein chicken plate with broccolini. I was blown away!!! The decor is cute! Nicely dimly lit, It was romantic and very chic. I recommend coming if you're a vegan looking for a good dinner!"
67995,7/28/11 11:30,3,"I've dined here a few times with my family and we keep coming back, despite a few misses.  I really want to be a fan of this place though. The red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous.  The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos, either brisket or fish and they're really great, though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.  
Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl, coupled with distracted waitstaff, became empty quickly.
My wife and I split the main dish, which was a special ""baked brisket enchilada"" recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too, but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese. 
It will be awhile before we go again, and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary, lots to like here, but I'd say stick to the basics."
61637,1/3/15 22:03,5,"Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great, nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!"
36216,2/23/16 19:51,3,"We had the curry it was really good but it was small portion for it's price.. the garlic chicken wasn't satisfying since it was dry, no spices, very plain and the chicken was kinda hard. Presentation was ok, you gotta order the rice seperate.. the service was fine the servers were pretty casual with their guests. Would come back for curry but not for tandoori or kabob."
42633,3/7/16 02:02,2,"So based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case..arrived just after 5pm..they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down...after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table...went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us...after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk. ..and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out...and they didn't have our full order..it took the food runner 3 separate trips..heres a run down of our order
Pulled chicken..not actually pulled but diced and dry
Turkey..very good moist and tender 
Pulled pork..very good..lot of flavor
Mac and cheese..not the best but not the worst
Greenbeens..good..the only hot side we got
Banana bread pudding..full of butter but not horrible
Overall food was 3 stars service was 1"
5769,11/9/16 20:24,5,"I love this place. I come here whenever I'm in town for business. The taco Tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing. The tacos are only two dollars each, but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are. They also have a good IPA on tap that is only five dollars a pint. All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue. They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well."
2491,10/27/14 04:19,4,"Love this place. Great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class. Great house beers, friendly serving staff, amazing drunk food. A fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu"
143668,1/17/14 00:59,4,"We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back. 

It is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling. 

The wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. 

If we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place."
97837,4/27/18 18:53,4,"Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!"
63046,6/24/13 06:42,2,"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. 

I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.

Service: 4 stars

61274,3/20/11 01:54,4,Love this place.  We go all the time.  Wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced.  Don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on Thurnderbird and 43 avenue.
188661,6/11/16 20:38,4,"Food is prepared fresh and flavored are great. Eaten three lunches and all were great. Service is a combined effort, so they on top of any needs."
23314,11/9/16 20:39,5,Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!
54372,7/28/14 01:20,5,"I went here yesterday and I got the best service I ever got at a restaurant. The waiter helped me on the grill constantly checked on me to see if everything was ok, the food was great and so was the service and everything was A++++ pricing was great as well it came out to around $18.

I am going back to Vegas for my Birthday next month I will try there sushis."
143487,5/28/18 20:23,5,"Juan's is ALWAYS busy because it's ALWAYS good. It's great food, but the excellent, friendly service is what keeps people coming back. I've been here dozens of times...date nights, with family, with kids, girls nights. Always wonderful. Try the shrimp ceviche!"
162751,9/4/13 01:29,4,Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!
125478,4/28/15 19:37,5,"Fabulous. A friend took me here last night. Wonderful food, we had panang curry, duck fried rice and Chilean sea bass.  What a wonderful combination of flavors."
143487,11/21/16 21:20,4,"We usually go to Lindo Michoacán when we want Mexican at a sit down restaurant, but I felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying Juan's.
Ok, we're hooked! Service was great.
We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.
My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.
Prices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat.
We will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!"
78686,5/31/16 05:00,5,My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!
63558,1/3/15 23:45,4,"Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food . I don't drink so I can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place ."
150025,9/9/14 19:23,1,"--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! 

This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. 

Management provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!"
181507,12/29/17 15:15,5,"The food was great Our server Karu was the bomb he was cool, very nice and good looking guy. It's the perfect spot for the bring friends and group. Great atmosphere and great menu choices.  SPICY... but its good haha.  Defenitely coming back!!!"
100001,2/5/14 18:35,5,Much better coffee than the big chains.  This is a great place for a quick lunch or breakfast and the drive through makes caffeine fill ups easy.
153845,7/14/16 18:51,5,Freaking BOMB Macaroni & Cheese and Everything Else was Awesome as well great Service again everything was OUTSTANDING
175247,7/3/16 17:23,2,"So let me start out. The ambiance of the facility is amazing.  Very classy.  But that doesn't compensate for the service I received.   I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.
I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the ""sex sells"" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. 
To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.  
This place will not be recommended to anybody I know
The food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits."
62237,10/13/09 12:57,4,"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. 

Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area."
101708,9/8/17 23:17,5,"A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago, it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar. 
We had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!
I would recommend making reservations next time, the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food, not too much room."
31721,4/19/14 13:17,5,"Danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much, made good suggestions and generally let us be silly, nearby table neighbors were great, food was fresh and tasty. I had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful. The man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce. 

The salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful. We also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty, not gourmet, just perfectly normal, fresh tasting tomato, basil and olive oil yumminess.

We also had a trio of their Dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!

Overall, even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting), with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!"
93309,3/27/17 01:14,5,"Love coming back to this location, one of the best ones I've been to. Have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store. We always get helped out by Chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home, also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks"
157645,8/24/11 22:56,2,"Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)

The appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star. 
Peach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for... 

I highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in."
127119,12/4/16 02:11,4,"Hy Steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house, with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience.

We started with the Famous Cheese Toast, oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters.  And the beef tartare, which was made table side and served with small biscuits.

We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.

Our server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.

The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.

In conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate. The food is more old fashioned, come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg."
9163,7/16/12 02:30,3,"I went here for lunch and got the grilled cajun chicken sandwich and salad, both of which were fine.  The service was really good.  Overall, not a bad place, but nothing spectacular."
192547,11/14/13 02:38,4,"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again."
107531,9/14/18 02:58,5,"I am speechless. I am without words to properly describe this place. Everything about this place is amazing. The staff, the food, everything. I ate one meal today and I made it count by getting the 2-meat plate with brisket and ribs with grits and beans as the sides. The ribs had to be my favorite, but my mind was blown by the jalapeño cheddar grits, and then lord the brisket and beans. Oh hell, who am I kidding I can't put these in any order. Eat everything here. I don't know who Bekke is, but she's got one hell of a pecan pie named after her."
186965,7/3/15 21:23,3,"Decent burgers here.  Didn't live up to the hype, though.

One thing that concerned me was the gal cooking the burgers had long hair that was not tied back.  Just an FYI in case you're squeamish about plucking hair out of your food."
67211,12/2/17 19:58,5,"Interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully.
I had Harajuku and Penicillin & they are amazing especially the penicillin. The dash of Islay really takes it to the next level.
All the bartender look very passionate & our main bartender Joseph was amazing.
Def worth stopping by."
1611,5/7/13 02:22,4,"I have been to Vintner Grill twice in two weeks recently.  The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner, the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him), but he just couldn't keep up in his section.

Hubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch, and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.

Please go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides, you never know what celebrity you may see!"
83606,11/30/14 01:29,3,"We were here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We had a party of 6. The server was great. She was on top of filling drinks and making sure to bring out any extras we had asked for with our meals. 

I had the turkey chipotle club wrap. It was ok. Nothing special but not bad. The fries are so good! My husband had the open face meatloaf and was really disappointed. He didn't even eat half!"
179242,4/28/12 12:44,4,Love this pub. The food is not great but if you stick to the pub grub faves. You should be fine. The best part about this place is the staff! All the girls that work here are amazing! :)
63046,9/8/17 23:29,5,Authentic and Rustic full of ambiance.. Great for families aswell as romantic dinners.. Ahhh the memories
143487,5/7/13 03:20,5,"Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!

Out of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  

We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  

We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!

The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  

This is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!"
184798,5/31/16 02:31,1,Over priced nasty nachos. The meat was so salty I couldn't eat them. And they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7. I will never go to this place again!!! This place sucks!!
75606,1/8/11 23:22,4,"After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off, a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.  

Wine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.

I'd be a regular if living in the area."
67995,11/9/16 19:59,5,"Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews, I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!

The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic. 

Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.

I'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!."
111982,10/27/11 12:54,4,"The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm...."
162751,11/14/13 05:18,2,"The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible, my Bloody Mary was disgusting, and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all."
9439,1/2/17 03:36,5,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant."
137030,2/13/11 16:20,2,"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return."
34159,6/26/12 00:31,4,"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria)."
159126,8/25/16 13:12,4,"Bruh, I'm a stickler for good wings.  Like to the point I can only eat them from about 4 places and I find those places to usually be inferior to the ones I make with my brother.

This place is a grade A dive and dump.  It is small, old, and needs remodeled,  but the wings are still great!

They get crispy right.  And, the service was nice too.

The Buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos.   Also enjoyed the dry cajun.  The sirachi were a bit of a miss though.

Also, get the fries.  Get a small because they give you so many, but man they are good.

In short, take it from a wing expert...  the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service."
67995,1/3/15 21:15,4,The chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that I could fill up on just those. They're addictive! We love the Paco's Taco with braised beef and charro beans. They have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive. Margaritas are unbelievable. Highly recommended.
22086,7/3/15 20:45,4,"3.5. Patio is great and spacious. Selection of beer and menu also great. I came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety. I ordered the steak tartare. It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought. The seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird, apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs. Either way, I would come back if I want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food."
143487,10/27/14 02:26,5,"Guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy. Not only is the good great, the customer service here is amazing. Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac, they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!"
105477,4/15/15 12:12,2,"way overrated, owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude. Overpriced for sure. Bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs, not mushy like Pickle Bills. They have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing."
79823,8/10/14 19:54,4,Food was pretty good however the prices are high. Waitress did a great job until she asked if I needed change.
52598,5/14/10 15:00,5,"Holy ""Made fresh at your table"" Guacamole!!!  My heart skips a beat just thinking about it.  Tex-Mex fine dining... at it's finest.
Also an important note:  One of my top five places to drink a house margarita."
4096,6/26/18 17:33,1,"There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times. 

We were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.  
One of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again, returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.  

I'll never return!"
177646,5/25/14 20:34,2,"My wife and I participated in the MS Walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous River Cafe a try.  What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise.
The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good.
The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.
Overall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back."

157652,10/7/15 22:34,5,"Great and fresh food (had filet mignon and asparagus), quick and friendly service, and warm atmosphere are the reasons for my 5 star rating.  They were very busy for 9pm on a Tuesday night so the locals love it.  The bar area is good for dining too.  TV's with Baseball playoffs were good for entertainment."
124297,5/20/09 01:41,3,"We checked this place out for dinner during race weeks. It was alllright. Ordered the ""thunder thighs"" - which sounded like buffalo wings made w chicken thighs, but ended up w regular wings. Not sure if we got the wrong order or if they are just called thighs when they are wings. Either way I was disappointed, but the wings were pretty decent after I got over the sadness.

At our table we had a chicken sandwich, a sausage and pepper hoagie, and a pork chop. The chicken was reported as good (wasn't mine), the pork was Ok but not out of this world, and the sausage was messy but good - had marinara sauce on it which was unexpected. The mac and cheese was a little greasy but pretty good.

As for the ""biker bar"" label.. I saw about 2 bikers and the rest of the crowd was regular peeps. The girls wear skimpy outfits so its not a family place for sure. 

It was ok, but I'm not dying to go back right away."

6939,1/8/11 23:48,5,The draft beer selection is great the tapas style menu is a perfect match and the upstairs is a great after work gathering place. But the best thing about this place is the bartender named Siti (sp) he is one of the best in Charlotte.
143487,1/17/14 07:15,4,In town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos. The waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when I pointed this out. He then replaced them as quickly as possible.
130178,8/19/15 04:03,3,"Had a 30 minute wait.. But played foosball (sow) to pass the time! 

The brisket nacho were really good! 

The bacon Mac-n-cheese burger was good but not great! 
The Motley Cue sandwich was rally good. Lots of mean.. Could probably split between 2 people

The wings.. Cutest presentation. 

Staff was eh.. I mean the place is busy. No time to be too friendly to all the damn tourist. Can't say that I blame them. 

Neat experience. Def worth a trip.. 

Next time will def try the desert.. This time we were too full!"
190175,5/27/11 06:24,5,"I admit that I haven't tried ALL the italian restaurants in Toronto... but of the ones that I have tried, Ciao has been the place that I've gone to multiple times. 

Why? Let me count the ways:
1. Reserved table is always ready 
2. Amazing service
3. Fabulous Wine Selection
4. The patio feels so European in the Summer
5. The portions are huge!
6. The quality and taste of the food is amaze
7. It's in Yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk
8. The olives with the bread - delish!

I feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but I also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!

ps. Be sure to order the Mushroom Risotto - it's divine!!"

100001,11/29/11 22:50,5,I love this place... it's great to have a neighborhood center with good food and great coffee!!  The patio is great all year long.
