125478,2014-12-17 19:04:33,5.0,"ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.  I'm so glad I came here.  One of the better meals I've had.  Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.  both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.  also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal, intimate setting, and great service. definitely will be back."
9439,2015-01-18 15:30:50,2.0,"Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars."

Thanks Jose! 
We will be back for sure."
41738,2015-07-16 07:31:28,1.0,"Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, ""Why do I come here???"" The staff often has the  ""GTFOH"" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed ""that guy.""  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit..."
117028,2015-06-21 00:56:28,4.0,received a  mailer and thought okay let's go. walked in on a Monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby. how cute however never got her name. looked over menu asked what was good she said the club. so ordered it and  yes it is good. had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center. really felt at ease there and good music playing. will go back again.
130178,2015-03-06 07:24:15,4.0,"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!"
130178,2016-01-30 01:08:03,5.0,"Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  ""Nailed it"" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!"
103432,2018-08-23 21:19:30,4.0,Quiet bar and grill great waitress and the margarita pizza was very good. Small sign out front and almost missed the place.
34159,2018-06-19 06:58:18,5.0,What an awesome pool party!!! I wish there was a tad more interactive aspects. I want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us.
97837,2018-04-27 18:59:14,5.0,"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!"
143487,2014-10-11 08:23:56,5.0,"I don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas I've ever had. Chips are perfect ,salsa is perfect, bean dip is perfect, and the best fried ice cream I've ever had. Plus the service is great."
37740,2017-03-27 01:24:15,5.0,"I had THE BEST VEGAN Gardein chicken plate with broccolini. I was blown away!!! The decor is cute! Nicely dimly lit, It was romantic and very chic. I recommend coming if you're a vegan looking for a good dinner!"
36216,2016-02-23 19:51:14,3.0,"We had the curry it was really good but it was small portion for it's price.. the garlic chicken wasn't satisfying since it was dry, no spices, very plain and the chicken was kinda hard. Presentation was ok, you gotta order the rice seperate.. the service was fine the servers were pretty casual with their guests. Would come back for curry but not for tandoori or kabob."
143668,2014-01-17 00:59:36,4.0,"We found out about this gem from The Man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt. complex we live in now. It's about a mile away from our apt. and we finally gave it a try a while back. 

It is delicious! The chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa. Very yum. The food is delicious! I don't remember what I had the last time we went here, but I managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later, IMO). The portions are generous and filling. 

The wait staff is always nice and attentive. I remember the first time we visited, it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. 

If we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience, we definitely choose this place."
97837,2018-04-27 18:53:06,4.0,"Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!"
63046,2013-06-24 06:42:29,2.0,"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. 

I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.

Service: 4 stars

Kitch: 4 stars

Food: 1 star"
23314,2016-11-09 20:39:39,5.0,Awesome food and service! Really wish we had one in Oahu! Our servers were on it! Thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!
143487,2018-05-28 20:23:06,5.0,"Juan's is ALWAYS busy because it's ALWAYS good. It's great food, but the excellent, friendly service is what keeps people coming back. I've been here dozens of times...date nights, with family, with kids, girls nights. Always wonderful. Try the shrimp ceviche!"
125478,2015-04-28 19:37:07,5.0,"Fabulous. A friend took me here last night. Wonderful food, we had panang curry, duck fried rice and Chilean sea bass.  What a wonderful combination of flavors."
143487,2016-11-21 21:20:29,4.0,"We usually go to Lindo Michoacán when we want Mexican at a sit down restaurant, but I felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying Juan's.
Ok, we're hooked! Service was great.
We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.
My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.
Prices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat.
We will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!"

101708,2017-09-08 23:17:03,5.0,"A wonderful dinner experience! Hubby and I came couple months ago, it was our first time at Sushi Samba. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar. 
We had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!
I would recommend making reservations next time, the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food, not too much room."
192547,2013-11-14 02:38:47,4.0,"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again."
67211,2017-12-02 19:58:19,5.0,"Interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully.
I had Harajuku and Penicillin & they are amazing especially the penicillin. The dash of Islay really takes it to the next level.
All the bartender look very passionate & our main bartender Joseph was amazing.
Def worth stopping by."
1611,2013-05-07 02:22:07,4.0,"I have been to Vintner Grill twice in two weeks recently.  The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner, the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him), but he just couldn't keep up in his section.

Hubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch, and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.

Please go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides, you never know what celebrity you may see!"
63046,2017-09-08 23:29:55,5.0,Authentic and Rustic full of ambiance.. Great for families aswell as romantic dinners.. Ahhh the memories
143487,2013-05-07 03:20:21,5.0,"Fajitas on Fire.  5 beers in a bucket for $15. Good chips and Salsa.  Mariachi Band.  Strategic TV's for all seats.  Excellent Margaritas. Kid friendly. This place rocks!!!

Out of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  

We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  

We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!

The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  

This is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!"
184798,2016-05-31 02:31:41,1.0,Over priced nasty nachos. The meat was so salty I couldn't eat them. And they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7. I will never go to this place again!!! This place sucks!!
9439,2017-01-02 03:36:36,5.0,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant."
137030,2011-02-13 16:20:42,2.0,"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return."
34159,2012-06-26 00:31:09,4.0,"First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria)."
143487,2014-10-27 02:26:54,5.0,"Guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy. Not only is the good great, the customer service here is amazing. Can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! Food is always fresh and never disappointing. Fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac, they'll prepare it at your table! It's like dinner and a show! Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!"
91868,2017-02-19 09:17:53,5.0,It's awesome here!!The guys are soooo hot and nice!!The host London is amazing at the mic and getting the crowd excited!!highly recommend this place!!
143487,2014-01-17 07:15:57,4.0,In town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos. The waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when I pointed this out. He then replaced them as quickly as possible.
130178,2015-08-19 04:03:25,3.0,"Had a 30 minute wait.. But played foosball (sow) to pass the time! 

The brisket nacho were really good! 

The bacon Mac-n-cheese burger was good but not great! 
The Motley Cue sandwich was rally good. Lots of mean.. Could probably split between 2 people

The wings.. Cutest presentation. 

Staff was eh.. I mean the place is busy. No time to be too friendly to all the damn tourist. Can't say that I blame them. 

Neat experience. Def worth a trip.. 

Next time will def try the desert.. This time we were too full!"
34159,2013-05-07 15:53:13,2.0,"There is absolutely no point in coming here if you come late or do not have a daybed.  You won't have anywhere to put your stuff which is a nuisance.  There is bag check but the lines are long.  Plus, sometimes you don't want to stand the entire time in the pool after standing in the long lines in the sun.  I saw a girl get hooked up to an IV and taken out on a wheelchair.  Stay classy, Vegas.

Also.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.  If you do decide to go here, you can go in with full-fledged self-confidence because people will flaunt their stretch marks, cellulite, and other goodies."

130178,2016-05-07 01:58:41,3.0,"This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

Two stars or even one if not for the Bloody Mary meal or Jack Daniels chocolate cake."
187126,2017-08-16 06:54:48,5.0,"We had breakfast there today for about $25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from JW Marriott and they didn't charge for the kid. Food was ok but plentiful and what makes it a 5-star for me is the ambience and the patio with the beautiful koi pond and cascades, refreshing in a summer morning. Staff was attentive amd we were there at 10 and breakfast ends at 11 but didn't fell pressured at all and nobody gave us looks for taking some fruit with us on our way out ;-)"
101708,2012-02-21 20:10:36,4.0,"I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. 

We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) 
- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) 
- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)
- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  
- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. 
- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! 
- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) 
- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! 
- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  

***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol 

OVERALL RATINGS:
Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)
Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! 
Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio
Presentation - 4 stars
Service & Ambiance - 4 stars

I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!"
137030,2015-08-19 06:30:41,2.0,This place looks hopeful on the outside but is actually pretty bad. My maple glazed salmon was very burnt and lacked flavor. The asparagus it came with was pretty disgusting and soggy. The waitress was great and the side Caesar salad I had was good. The experience was horrible simply due to the blasting crappy music as well. Probably don't eat here.
130178,2014-11-30 03:22:06,4.0,"This place is over the top! The food is great and the portions...when the hell did every restaurant in Vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers. My family had a great mix of food - the Mayor of Flavortown Burger, Motley Que Sandwich and Vegas Fries. Don't kid yourself, the fries aren't a side; not by a long shot. They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. 

This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. 

My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either. She gave me a look like, do you still want in or not, I have other people to be rude to."

Guy is one of my favorite chefs i know, he's so cool and i love his since of humor. but his menu is lacking to me. its so concentrated which can be good... if the quality can hold up to it. i got the bacon cheese burger and i could have gotten the same thing at half the price 3 blocks down the strip. seasonings were bland and LOTS of grease. the reason your getting 3 starts Guy is because I'm more the sure this restaurant doesn't represent you very well."
153845,2016-01-17 07:30:48,3.0,Just okay. Was expecting more based on a friends  referral but the food was average and the service was slow and left me disappointed. $38 for a steak so I expected much more. The Brussel sprouts small plate was on point but overall would not return to this spot.

34159,2017-07-18 18:49:04,5.0,"7/15/17. Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. 

As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. 

We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said ""this happens all the time."" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). 

Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. 

Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best. 

Thanks again! :-)"
101708,2017-03-27 01:44:42,4.0,"Been a while since we came here but loved it.  Little bit loud but ok and maybe not as fancy as some of its other locations (Chicago, Miami), but:

- food was same and awesome.  
- loved the Wygu Beef Gyoza, couple rolls we had, salad, drinks, etc.

Great menu right now they have to choose from.  Seems the same in all cities for the moment."
143487,2018-01-09 20:48:22,5.0,"best fajita in town in my opinion! we have been there twice, and the only thing we ordered was fajita for two with beef only. it was always awesome and delicious. staff was courteous there, and the price was reasonable. We aren't gonna go anywhere else for fajita from now on xD."
34159,2012-06-26 00:31:08,2.0,"Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.

I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)

So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:

There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???

The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.

If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.

Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.

Not going back."
143487,2017-12-02 20:04:40,5.0,"By far the best Mexican food we have had in Las Vegas. The fideo soup was loaded with flavor and so we're the salsas. We ordered the lunch combinations so we could try a variety and we were not disappointed by any of them. The service was impeccable, we will definitely be back soon."
34159,2017-06-27 23:52:19,5.0,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions. Just went to Vegas this past weekend and had a blast."
65124,2015-07-28 08:40:01,4.0,"First time in this place. Pretty impressive. I liked the lemon popcorn chicken with green onions..good flavor and sauce. The soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually, I wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy. Bimbap was excellent. Delicious and very comforting. Of course all the sides great as usual with Korean Cuisine. Overall, we were pretty happy. Service was good, even though I've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention. I am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy. Would come back and have a few other things on the menu."
96069,2018-05-28 20:26:32,5.0,Jason recommended the penne shrimp dish its was awesome. Definitely request Jason as your waiter. We will be back
162637,2015-10-07 23:03:24,5.0,"Love this place! Very high quality, if not pricey food. The reason for this 5 star review is for their happy hour. The prime burger is one of my favorite burgers in town & during happy hour it's only $7 for this quality bacon burger. You get your choice of cheese ( I get blue) & a side of fries. If your a burger lover check out one of the best deals in Vegas."
135546,2015-10-07 23:24:04,5.0,"This place is a hidden gem! We moved to Vegas from San Francisco last year and have been here several times since. I took some friends here last weekend, that were visiting and they fell in love with it too. The play yard in the back is a blast!! So much fun!! Drinks are super affordable. We had an adorable waitress named Anne Marie and she was awesome! Super nice, quick with our drinks, very attentive and personable. I've been a server before so I'm a bit picky but she was on it! Love this place!"

Our server, Brandon gave us the best recommendations and we couldn't have been more pleased with his service. 

MUST EATS: Trios of Picos and get the side of Guac. It comes with chips, plantains and arepas ... Chicharrones - my boyfriend said these were the best wings he's ever had! The onions and sauce made the dish!! For entrees, get the Braised Short Rib and Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. We both agree they were phenomenal. 

MUST DRINK: Chica-Rita - holy cow - the most amazing drink!!!! Not on the menu, but Brendon also whipped us up a Mezcal Old Fashioned, which was nothing short of perfect."
192547,2016-07-03 19:21:55,1.0,"The most bland tasting Italian food that I have ever had! Unfortunately, the only good thing was the cappacino. Very over priced as well! The food comes out on basically an assembly line with a salad extremely drenched in dressing. Garlic bread was decent. I was very excited to go to this restaurant and it was a major let down for my family. We had linguine and clams,manicotti,and lasagna. Each dish was equally lackluster."
192547,2017-09-20 14:22:31,3.0,"I was a little disappointed in the speed of seating guests. I had an 8:30 reservation and was not seated until 8:45, aside from arriving at 8:15. After being seated, service was not bad. The food was tasty and they give you large portions. I had shrimp alfredo and was pleased. They serve you bread a salad before your entree and they are both delish! After your meal, they also serve cappuccino. It was very tasty. I love the ""hole in the wall"" ambience and decor. They even have the menu up on the wall lol. Overall it was a nice experience."
162637,2018-03-15 19:27:41,5.0,This is a great steakhouse! We celebrated my birthday here! Started with the calamari which was really good. Didn't expect the twist with the sweet chili sauce.

We let it go and went on with our night but even the nicest clubs in vegas are not that much! Added bonus everyon starts leaving around 12 and you yourself will have to leave before 1 or youll be bounced out too!"

130178,2015-12-20 22:30:31,4.0,"Excellent service and extremely rich tasting food, Guy has taken sports bar food to a new level of decadence. I had the Triple T fries and 14-hour Brisket sandwich. The meal was heavily portioned. The truffle oil laden fries were topped with minced garlic, cheese, and cilantro. The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious. Ashley made our experience perfect, attending to our wants and needs, making great suggestions, and patient. My suggestions though are to order margaritas or the ginger mint cocktail to temper the creamy robust and overwhelming at times. Please share because the tastes are to strong to eat the same dish for 30 minutes, mix it up and prepare for large portions."
130178,2016-07-03 19:00:59,3.0,"So my Wife and I along with my son stopped in for two meals while we were staying at the Linq Hotel.

Dinner.  We all had a great Time the service was great the food was great, Wife and I both had the Cesar Salad I added Chicken the wife did not.  I added a wing order plain with both sauces on the side,  another great choice! My son ordered the volcano fries I believe.  They were a little spicy for him but I had one and they were also very good.  

Experience #1 ""4 Stars""

Breakfast the next Morning:  Being we had such a good experience the night before we decided we should try breakfast.  WOW did things change.  The only part of this experience that was favorable was the Hostesses!  They met you without delay and were extremely polite.  From Mount Everest to Death Valley from there.  We sat down and waited a while for our server ""Eric"" to arrive.  When he did he looked alike he had just gotten out of bed, and acted like we were wasting his time.  We ordered three things.  

1.  Steak and Eggs which definitely missed their stop on Flavor Town, Extremely Bland!  Cooked well but again very bland.  

2.  Chilaquiles.  Looked like it sat under a heat lamp too long and again other that the carne Asada which did taste ok we were not a fan.

3.  Chicken fried Bacon biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy was obviously prepared by someone different the the cook that prepared the Bacon which was just above Raw.  Remember the Gravy?  Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!  

Let me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.  

Also if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.

Experience #2. 2 Stars.

Over all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars. 

Lastly the Hash House must be where Guy eats when he is in town.  They waiter stated that he had been there for a while and that Guy doesn't even stop buy when he is in town.  

We did try the Hash House A GO Go and it was great. Long wait but well worth it!!!!!!"
1611,2015-07-28 16:53:47,5.0,"Exceptional in food quality, taste and ambience. 

The Dinner- 
Moscow Mule-Plenty of vodka, spiced with candied ginger and lime. 

Appetizer- Cheese and Meat Assortment; Venison, Prosciutto, goat and cow cheese options. 

The half chicken with honey truffle sauce- Light yet robust, with ''Mac and Cheese'

Dessert- Lemon Cheesecake, Spiced Pumpkin Brulee and Tiramisu Cappuccino. 

The Lemon citrus notes blended perfect with the cheesecake creating a noticeable and pleasant accent with the creamy texture of cheesecake. 

Tiramisu Cappuccino- Thick whipped texture. Very Rich. I recommend sharing. 

Spiced Pumpkin Brulee- Solid dependable Crème' Brulee.

The service was attentive and the ambience is unique and tasteful. 

Vintner Grill was difficult to find hidden inside an office suite complex. Trust your map. Its tucked away right off the main road. Experience was enjoyable and the food memorable."

9439,2012-10-08 17:10:48,1.0,"We visited last week.  Be Warned! My husband's sister ordered a cheeseburger.  The waiter asked how she wanted it cooked and explained that ""Medium"" would be pink through-out.  She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated ""No, I don't want it now"".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my ""perception"" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won't be back."

I'm on my own these days, and on most evenings my company is the latest issue of Sports Illustrated.

As that wasn't the case, there was no lack of professionalism whatsoever. Fact is, while I really enjoy all the elements (food, service, ambience) at this Fleming's, it's the personal treatment that keeps me coming back. I thought this needed to be said."
137030,2015-12-20 19:31:18,5.0,Best place for steaks bar none. Every Sunday all steak 1/2 off. Great place to watch some football while you eat. I'm not a salad kind of guy but this place make great salads too. Everything on the menus are great!
101708,2009-05-20 00:04:00,5.0,"Out of all the restaurants I've been to in Vegas, I must say....Sushi Samba is probably the best one I've eaten at!  

Though the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that I ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  I would recommend everything I ordered for those that are going there.  
Here's what I ordered for 2 people:
1) sea bass and miso antichucos....the Peruvian corn that comes with it was quite tasty
2) agedashi tofu....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good.
3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll.
4)  some sort of spicy tuna roll.  the tuna was high quality...VERY FRESH!
5) Peruvian hot chocolate....this was DAMN good!  The drink was thick and very creamy.
6) Mango honey crisp taquito.  

thinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.  
the service there was EXCELLENT!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.

BE AWARE though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.  

Sushi Samba is a definite must!"

53617,2010-07-07 20:08:58,1.0,"Service is terrible. 

There were 2 of us, the hostess sat us with only one menu. After we had to take turns to share the menu, we finally decided on our entrees. 30 minutes passed, no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave. On our way out I wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted, after which she asked ""what table number were you at?"" How am I supposed to know? Is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on?"
67070,2016-07-14 19:39:07,5.0,"Price points are awesome 2 different happy hours. Great menu of food and drinks. They do brunch and also live music and DJ,so. This new place will soon be popular."
153845,2017-08-16 13:06:11,2.0,"We arrived during the mid-day Beat the Clock Happy Hour. Our waitress took about 10 minutes to take our order. I ordered a margarita. She forgot to ask salt or no, so I sent it back and asked if I could have one no salt; she just wiped the salt off of it. We had ordered 2 appetizers, but they came 20 minutes in between. We asked for the manager & the waitress became nicer. I felt like the length of service was designed to avoid ""Beating the Clock""."
135546,2014-05-07 18:17:16,4.0,"I think the Gold Spike is uber swank, I like it here. It reminds me of the Bay Area. Had a private tour of the room renovations and an explanation of the ""vision"" for downtown. Wait and see I say, Vegas is reinventing herself every chance she gets.
The crowd here is business/professional/casual/hip at least it has been every time I have been in. Again, reminds me of the Bay."
41738,2015-10-08 01:13:50,3.0,"Been going here the last couple Sundays to watch Niner games with the Niner Nation, who reserves a room with a large screen TV. I've been a little late as I watch the morning games until conclusion to check my fantasy points, so the room has been packed and I get stuck at the bar. They are a friendly group of people so that's cool.

This review is for the bar itself, and the specials. $3 bloody mary's, coors light, and some other beer I will never drink. Food specials are only $4.99 cheeseburgers w/fries, chili cheese dog, or some fancy fries. I usually get the cheeseburger and its been OK. The bloody marys are pretty weak and pretty tame. Service is extremely busy, and so its hit or miss after you initially sit down and order. 

Overall, its a nice bar with a raised table seating area, a large bar with gaming, and a couple of rooms for groups. TV's everywhere so you won't miss any of the action. I'll be back for sure to root for my Niners, and as they lose proceed to enjoy alcoholic beverages."
153845,2017-03-03 18:42:15,1.0,"What a horrible experience! I came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon shortly after landing in Las Vegas. I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty! 

Well first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me. 

Secondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible. 

The waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse. 

The mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should've just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it. But I was so pissed off and in complete disbelief at the service and experience I couldn't think logically. This place has got to get it together."
130178,2014-08-24 21:13:47,2.0,"Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For ""shareable"",  respectable ""sashimi won-taco"" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The ""fondue dippers"" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

""Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie"".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A ""big dipper"" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The ""off-da-hook smash burger"" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the ""mac-n-cheese bacon burger""  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.  

Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere."
153845,2015-10-17 00:56:42,1.0,"After we were seated by the hostess, we spent 10 minutes waiting for someone to even address us with about 7 waiters and waitresses passing us by. Finally, my friend went to the bar to go get us some waters. I then got up and approached one of the waitresses and asked her if she could help us locate our waiter. Her response was ""go talk to the hostess"". Annoyed, I then asked her if she could send a manager over. She turned around and continued serving her tables. Finally the hostess came over and I asked again to speak to the manager. The manager finally came over to our table and asked ""can I help you?"". I started explaining the situation and he cut me off before I could get one sentence out and asked what we were ordering. He was uninterested in our concern, did not apologize, and made some lame excuse like the hostess shouldn't have brought us there. Our food came out quickly, but they forgot a side salad that we ordered and the food was questionably not warm. The manager never followed up at the end and clearly did not care about our concerns in the slightest. The horrible service and mediocre food is not worth stepping foot in this place."
157078,2018-02-11 03:30:35,3.0,"Came to have dinner and they were pretty busy. We  took a high top table cause it was less of a wait. Ordered the bacon burger with NO ONIONS and guess what? It came with freaking onions! Ofcourse it never fails, waitress offered to make me another one but I didn't really feel like waiting 30 minutes for a burger so I took them off myself but the taste was still there . Be careful with those little iPads / game things they are not free! It will charge you $2 to play a game so don't do it accidentally! Waitress was very helpful."
137030,2015-06-21 02:13:56,2.0,The service sucks and it's really overpriced. We came for dinner took a look at the menu ordered the philly steak fries for an Appetizer which were delicious by the way!  Our waitress took forever and the atmosphere was ok at best. Dark bar atmosphere is how I would describe it. It's a place I would go for drinks with a few friends but not dinner.
142312,2011-01-09 01:31:03,4.0,"Let Vegas bring HonkyTonk Town to YOU. 3 STARS, EXTRA STAR GOES TO JESSICA C.

[ATMOSPHERE] : 
20 Burgers && Sandwiches to choose from 
+ People square dancing on the dance floor
+ Country music filling up the atmosphere
+ Band on stage
+ Dim tasteful bar feel with some lighting (just incase beer goggle's not enough *nudge nudge*)
.. minus mechanical bull *sad face*

Chicks in chaps && boy shorts? Don't worry boys, you won't be needing beer goggles in that department ;]

On top of that they had a free Burger && Beer deal for troops the time I was there. Showing their love && support for troops, huge burgers && drinking straight out of jars: nothing screams American Pride more than that. 

[SERVICE] :
Jessica's the BEST. My entire table pretty much all ordered the free meal deal and 2 appetizers. I can understand what an annoyance it can be to have 2 handfuls of troops come in and ask for the free burger && beer deal. Poor thing had to carry out 10 plates && 10 beers knowing that the tab's only going to be $25 at most (for the 2 appetizers). Given the scenario, I honestly didn't expect her to come by and check up on us, but she did. And she was so attentive despite what 20% of $25 is (don't worry, she got waaay more than 20% of the tab).

I'd give this place 5 stars if they didn't charge so much for mediocre food. $14 for an OK tasting burger? Cmon now. I can slap together the same burger @ home for $12.50 cheaper!"
135546,2016-04-11 17:50:05,5.0,This place is so cool. We stayed at the hotel and had most of our meals at the gold spike. My favorite waitress is Angelina. She is so friendly and attentive. The food was cooked perfect every time. The back yard is a grate place for adults in body but kids at heart. It was a little loud but that is to be expected at a bar. Love it.
